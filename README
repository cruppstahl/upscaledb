This is the README file of hamsterdb Embedded Storage.

Contents:

1. About

hamsterdb Embedded Storage is a database engine written in ANSI C. It supports 
a B+Tree index structure, uses memory mapped I/O (if available), supports 
fast Cursors and variable length keys and can create In-Memory Databases.

This release fixed a few bugs and refactored lots of code. Additionally,
a new feature was introduced: duplicate keys can now be sorted.

2. Changes

New Features
* Duplicate keys can now be sorted (see ham_set_duplicate_compare_func and
    HAM_SORT_DUPLICATES)

Bugfixes
* If multiple Databases in an Environment are open, an open
    Transaction was not immediately closed when the first Database
    was closed (with ham_close)
* If multiple Databases in an Environment are open, and just one
    Database was closed, then the pages of this Database were not flushed
    correctly
* Fixed crash on Linux 64bit/gcc 4.4 with compiler optimization

Other Changes
* The documentation is now reduced to public interfaces; internal
    documentation is only built when requested
* A lot of refactoring and code improvements

To see a list of all changes, look in the file ChangeLog.

3. Roadmap

- continue internal code cleanups
- allow sorting of duplicate keys
- improve documentation (tutorial)

4. Features

- Very fast sorted B+Tree with variable length keys
- Can run as an in-memory database
- Supports multiple databases in one file
- Supports record number databases ("auto-increment")
- Supports duplicate keys (with sorting)
- Support for logging and recovery
- Support for Transactions (only one Transaction at a time, requires logging)
- Very fast database cursors 
- Configurable page size, cache size and index key size
- Portable ANSI-C implementation
- Runs on Linux, Unices, Microsoft Windows, Windows CE and on many
    architectures (also embedded and SPARC)
- Endian-independent file format
- Uses memory mapped I/O for fast disk access (but falls back to read/write if
    mmap is not available)
- Uses 64bit file pointers and supports huge files (>2 GB)
- Easy to use and well-documented
- Supports rudimentary live-reorganization by automatically
    merging freelist entries
- Open source and released under the GPL 2.0 or later
- Supports AES encryption and zlib compression
- Wrappers for C++, Python, Java and .NET

5. Known Issues/Bugs

None.

6. Compiling 

6.1 Linux and Cygwin/Win32

To compile hamsterdb Embedded Storage, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library, 
build with debugging symbols etc).

6.2 Microsoft Visual Studio 8

A Solution file is provided for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005:
'win32/hamsterdb.sln'. It compiles a static and a dynamic library. 
Please read the README.TXT file in the win32 directory.
All libraries can be downloaded precompiled from the hamsterdb webpage.

To download Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

7. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles several example programs in the directory
'samples'. To see hamsterdb Embedded Storage in action, just run 'samples/db1' 
or any other sample. (or 'win32/out/samples/db1/db1.exe' on Windows platforms).

8. API Documentation

The header files in 'include/ham' have extensive comments. Also, a doxygen
script is available; run 'make doc' to start doxygen. The generated
documentation is also available on the hamsterdb web page.

9. Other Ways to Compile hamsterdb Embedded Storage

If you want to compile hamsterdb without using the provided ./configure
environment, you have to set some preprocessor macros:

DEBUG                   enable debugging output and diagnostic checks (slow!)
HAM_LITTLE_ENDIAN       compile for little endian machines (i.e. x86)
HAM_BIG_ENDIAN          compile for big endian machines (most other
                            architectures)
HAM_32BIT               compile for 32bit (alias: WIN32)
HAM_64BIT               compile for 64bit (alias: WIN64, also needs WIN32)
HAM_ENABLE_INTERNAL     enable internal functions (declared in
                            include/ham/hamsterdb_int.h)
HAM_DISABLE_COMPRESSION build without support for zlib compression
HAM_DISABLE_ENCRYPTION  build without support for AES encryption

Also, if you compile for windows, you have to compile the file 'src/os_win32.c',
and ignore the file 'src/os_posix.c'. Vice versa on non-Windows platforms.

10. Porting hamsterdb Embedded Storage

Porting hamsterdb Embedded Storage shouldn't be too difficult. All operating 
system dependend functions are declared in 'src/os.h' and defined 
in 'src/os_win32.c' or 'src/os_posix.c'. 
Other compiler- and OS-specific macros are in 'include/ham/types.h'. 
Most likely, these are the only files which have to be touched. Also see item 
9) for important macros. 

11. Licensing

hamsterdb Embedded Storage can be licensed on a per-developer basis for 
closed source applications. For more details, see 
http://hamsterdb.com/licensing and http://hamsterdb.com/store.

hamsterdb Embedded Storage is released under GPL2 or later. There are several 
exceptions for other open source licenses (see 
http://hamsterdb.com/licensing/exceptions for legal information and a license 
list).
