This is the README file of hamsterdb pro.

1. About

This release of hamsterdb pro is based on hamsterdb 2.1.9, and contains the
following additional changes:

- Added CRC32 verification (use HAM_ENABLE_CRC32)
- SIMD instructions are now also used if duplicates are enabled (the use of
    duplicate keys prevented SIMD instructions in the previous versions)
- SIMD instructions are now also used for HAM_TYPE_REAL64 keys

Please visit the webpage for additional documentation.

2. Changes

New Features
* Enabling SIMD support for duplicate keys
* Added new parameter to set a file size limit - HAM_PARAM_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT
* Added SIMD support for HAM_TYPE_REAL64 keys

Bugfixes
* Fixed segfault when opening a file with HAM_ENABLE_RECOVERY (and
	without HAM_ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS)

Other Changes
* hamserver now also compiles against libuv 0.10.25 (in addition to 0.11.*)

To see a list of all changes, look in the file ChangeLog.

3. Roadmap
- See https://github.com/cruppstahl/hamsterdb/wiki/Roadmap

4. Features

- PRO: SIMD instructions for lookups
- PRO: CRC32 verification
- PRO: transparent AES encryption
- PRO: transparent CRC32 verification
- PRO: transparent compression for journal, keys and records using 
    zlib, snappy, lzf or lzo 
- Very fast sorted B+Tree with variable length keys
- Basic schema support for POD types (i.e. uint32, uint64, real32 etc)

  mmap is not available)
- Uses 64bit file pointers and supports huge files (>2 GB)

- Open source and released under APL 2.0 license
- Wrappers for C++, Java, .NET, Erlang, Python, Ada and others

5. Known Issues/Bugs

None.

6. Compiling

6.1 Linux, MacOS and other Unix systems

To compile hamsterdb, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library,
build with debugging symbols etc).

6.2 Microsoft Visual Studio 8

A Solution file is provided for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005:
'win32/hamsterdb.sln'. It compiles a static and a dynamic library.
Please read the README.TXT file in the win32 directory.
All libraries can be downloaded precompiled from the hamsterdb webpage.

To download Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

6.3 Dependencies

On Ubuntu, the following packages are required:
  - libdb-dev (optional)
  - protobuf-compiler
  - libprotobuf-dev
  - libgoogle-perftools-dev
  - libboost-system-dev
  - libboost-thread-dev
  - libboost-dev
  - (libuv needs to be installed from sources - see
      https://github.com/joyent/libuv)

For Windows, precompiled dependencies are available here:
https://github.com/cruppstahl/hamsterdb-alien

7. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles several example programs in the directory
'samples'. To see hamsterdb in action, just run 'samples/db1'
or any other sample. (or 'win32/out/samples/db1/db1.exe' on Windows platforms).

8. API Documentation

The header files in 'include/ham' have extensive comments. Also, a doxygen
script is available; run 'make doc' to start doxygen. The generated
documentation is also available on the hamsterdb web page.

9. Other Ways to Compile hamsterdb

If you want to compile hamsterdb without using the provided ./configure
environment, you have to set some preprocessor macros:

DEBUG                   enable debugging output and diagnostic checks (slow!)
HAM_32BIT               compile for 32bit (alias: WIN32)
HAM_64BIT               compile for 64bit (alias: WIN64, also needs WIN32)

Also, if you compile for windows, you have to compile the file
'src/os_win32.cc' and ignore the file 'src/os_posix.cc'. Vice versa on
non-Windows platforms.

10. Porting hamsterdb

Porting hamsterdb shouldn't be too difficult. All operating
system dependend functions are declared in 'src/os.h' and defined
in 'src/os_win32.cc' or 'src/os_posix.cc'.
Other compiler- and OS-specific macros are in 'include/ham/types.h'.
Most likely, these are the only files which have to be touched. Also see item
9) for important macros.

11. Migrating files from older versions

Usually, hamsterdb releases are backwards compatible. There are some exceptions,
though. In this case tools are provided to migrate the database. First, export
your existing database with ham_export linked against the old version.
(ham_export links statically and will NOT be confused if your system has a
newer version of hamsterdb installed). Then use the newest version of
ham_import to import the data into a new database. You can find ham_export
and ham_import in the "tools" subdirectory.

    Example (ham_export of 2.1.2 was renamed to ham_export-2.1.2 to document
        that it's an older version):

    ham_export-2.1.2 input.db | ham_import --stdin output.db

12. Licensing

hamsterdb is released under the APL 2.0 license, which allows
unrestricted use for commercial and non-commercial applications. See the
file COPYING for more information.

A commercial, closed source version hamsterdb pro with additional functionality
is available on request. See http://hamsterdb.com for more information.
