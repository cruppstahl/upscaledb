This is the README file of hamsterdb pro.

1. About

This is the first release of hamsterdb pro. It contains all features of
hamsterdb 2.1.7, and additionally:

- compression for journal, records and keys with zlib, snappy, lzf, lzo
        (use of lzo requires a commercial license!)
- aes encryption
- simd instructions for lookups in the PAX layout (fixed length numeric keys
        without duplicates)

Please visit the webpage for additional documentation.

2. Changes

New Features
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Adding the new "hola" API - hamsterdb analytical functions for COUNT,
	SUM, AVERAGE etc. See ham/hamsterdb_ola.h for the declarations
* Added new API ham_cursor_get_duplicate_position
* A new Python API was added

Bugfixes
* issue #33: upgraded to libuv 0.11.22
* Fixing a performance regression in 2.1.7 - large fixed-length keys
	created too many page splits, even if they were stored as extended
	keys

Other Changes
* The database format no longer tries to be endian agnostic; the database
	is now stored in host endian format. The endian agnostic code was broken
	anyway, and I had no hardware to test it.
* ham_db_get_error is now deprecated
* header files no longer include winsock.h to avoid conflicts with winsock2.h
	on Windows platforms
* Both btree layouts have been completely rewritten; PAX KeyLists
	can now be used in combination with duplicate RecordLists, and variable
	length KeyLists can now be used in combination with PAX RecordLists
* Avoiding Btree splits if keys are appended (HAM_HINT_APPEND)
* The internal communication with the remote server now uses a different
	protocol which is faster than google's protobuffer
* PAX layout now uses linear search for small ranges; this improves search
	performance by 5-10%
* Removed the ham_get_license API (and serial.h)
=======
* Compression is enabled in ham_env_create (HAM_PARAM_JOURNAL_COMPRESSION)
    or ham_env_create_db (HAM_PARAM_RECORD_COMPRESSION,
    HAM_PARAM_KEY_COMPRESSION)
* AES encryption is enabled in ham_env_create and ham_env_open
    (HAM_PARAM_ENCRYPTION_KEY)
* SIMD instructions are used for lookups in the PAX layout (numeric keys)

Bugfixes
* issue #33: upgraded to libuv 0.11.22
* Fixed a performance regression from 2.1.7: when using very large
    variable-length keys, the btree pages were split too early and lots of
    space was unused

Other Changes
* Minor performance improvements by reducing memory allocations
>>>>>>> PRO 2.1.7: commercial fork, heavy-weight compression for records, journal and

4. Features

- PRO: SIMD instructions for lookups (numeric keys)
- PRO: transparent AES encryption
- PRO: transparent compression for journal, keys and records using 
    zlib, snappy, lzf or lzo

5. Known Issues/Bugs

None.

6. Compiling

6.1 Linux, MacOS and other Unix systems

To compile hamsterdb, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library,
build with debugging symbols etc).

6.2 Microsoft Visual Studio 8

A Solution file is provided for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005:
'win32/hamsterdb.sln'. It compiles a static and a dynamic library.
Please read the README.TXT file in the win32 directory.
All libraries can be downloaded precompiled from the hamsterdb webpage.

To download Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

6.3 Dependencies

On Ubuntu, the following packages are required:
  - libdb-dev (optional)
  - protobuf-compiler
  - libprotobuf-dev
  - libgoogle-perftools-dev
  - libboost-system-dev
  - libboost-thread-dev
  - libboost-dev
  - (libuv needs to be installed from sources - see
      https://github.com/joyent/libuv)

For Windows, precompiled dependencies are available here:
https://github.com/cruppstahl/hamsterdb-alien

7. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles several example programs in the directory
'samples'. To see hamsterdb in action, just run 'samples/db1'
or any other sample. (or 'win32/out/samples/db1/db1.exe' on Windows platforms).

8. API Documentation

The header files in 'include/ham' have extensive comments. Also, a doxygen
script is available; run 'make doc' to start doxygen. The generated
documentation is also available on the hamsterdb web page.

9. Other Ways to Compile hamsterdb

If you want to compile hamsterdb without using the provided ./configure
environment, you have to set some preprocessor macros:

DEBUG                   enable debugging output and diagnostic checks (slow!)
HAM_32BIT               compile for 32bit (alias: WIN32)
HAM_64BIT               compile for 64bit (alias: WIN64, also needs WIN32)

Also, if you compile for windows, you have to compile the file
'src/os_win32.cc' and ignore the file 'src/os_posix.cc'. Vice versa on
non-Windows platforms.

10. Porting hamsterdb

Porting hamsterdb shouldn't be too difficult. All operating
system dependend functions are declared in 'src/os.h' and defined
in 'src/os_win32.cc' or 'src/os_posix.cc'.
Other compiler- and OS-specific macros are in 'include/ham/types.h'.
Most likely, these are the only files which have to be touched. Also see item
9) for important macros.

11. Migrating files from older versions

Usually, hamsterdb releases are backwards compatible. There are some exceptions,
though. In this case tools are provided to migrate the database. First, export
your existing database with ham_export linked against the old version.
(ham_export links statically and will NOT be confused if your system has a
newer version of hamsterdb installed). Then use the newest version of
ham_import to import the data into a new database. You can find ham_export
and ham_import in the "tools" subdirectory.

    Example (ham_export of 2.1.2 was renamed to ham_export-2.1.2 to document
        that it's an older version):

    ham_export-2.1.2 input.db | ham_import --stdin output.db

12. Licensing

hamsterdb is released under the APL 2.0 license, which allows
unrestricted use for commercial and non-commercial applications. See the
file COPYING for more information.

A commercial, closed source version hamsterdb pro with additional functionality
is available on request. See http://hamsterdb.com for more information.
