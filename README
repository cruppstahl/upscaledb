This is the README file of hamsterdb Embedded Storage.

Contents:

1. About

hamsterdb Embedded Storage is a database engine written in ANSI C. It supports
a B+Tree index structure, uses memory mapped I/O (if available),
fast Cursors and variable length keys and can create In-Memory Databases.

This release fixes several issues including a segmentation fault, a few
misplaced asserts and data corruption. It is highly recommended to
upgrade.

Bugfixes
Jul 21, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
* (java) Fixed race condition when closing Cursors (thanks, Mark S.)
* Fixed issue 8: Fixed data corruption when retrieving a record returns
    HAM_BLOB_NOT_FOUND (thanks, Artem)
* Fixed several bugs (mainly related to misplaced asserts) when performing
    recovery
* Fixed crash when reusing a page from the cache that was not correctly
    initialized (thanks, Jason)
* Fixed crash when HAM_ENABLE_RECOVERY w/o HAM_ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS (thanks,
    Peter)
* Fixed issue 7: approximate matching did not return the correct key
    (thanks, Artem)
* Fixed MacOS compilation problem
    (thanks, Jason P.)

Other Changes
* none

To see a list of all changes, look in the file ChangeLog.

3. Roadmap

- API cleanups, code refactoring
- fine-grained locking for faster concurrent access
- more transactional stuff (i.e. recreate pending transactions when
  recovering from a crash)

4. Features

- Very fast sorted B+Tree with variable length keys
- Can run as an in-memory database
- Supports multiple databases in one file
- Supports record number databases ("auto-increment")
- Supports duplicate keys (with sorting)
- Support for logging and recovery
- Support for unlimited number of parallel Transactions
- Support for partial reading/writing of records
- Support for network access (remote databases) through http
- Very fast database cursors
- Configurable page size, cache size and index key size
- Runs on Linux, Unices, Microsoft Windows, Windows CE and on many
  architectures (also embedded and SPARC)
- Endian-independent file format
- Uses memory mapped I/O for fast disk access (but falls back to read/write if
  mmap is not available)
- Uses 64bit file pointers and supports huge files (>2 GB)
- Easy to use and well-documented
- Supports rudimentary live-reorganization by automatically
  merging freelist entries
- Open source and released under the GPL 2.0 or later
- Supports AES encryption and zlib compression
- Wrappers for C++, Python, Java and .NET

5. Known Issues/Bugs

None.

6. Compiling

6.1 Linux and Cygwin/Win32

To compile hamsterdb Embedded Storage, run ./configure, make, make install.

Run `./configure --help' for more options (i.e. static/dynamic library,
build with debugging symbols etc).

6.2 Microsoft Visual Studio 8

A Solution file is provided for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005:
'win32/hamsterdb.sln'. It compiles a static and a dynamic library.
Please read the README.TXT file in the win32 directory.
All libraries can be downloaded precompiled from the hamsterdb webpage.

To download Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

6.3 Dependencies

hamsterdb will compile out of the box. On Unix, however, remote functionality
will be disabled if libcurl and Google protobuf SDKs are not installed. If
you want to include remote functionality, then you have to download the
dependencies from here:
    http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
    http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
    http://www.boost.org
On Ubuntu, you can install the following packages:
    protobuf-compiler
    libprotobuf-dev
    libcurl-dev
    libboost-dev

For Windows, precompiled libcurl/protobuf libraries are available on
hamsterdb.com.

7. Testing and Example Code

Make automatically compiles several example programs in the directory
'samples'. To see hamsterdb Embedded Storage in action, just run 'samples/db1'
or any other sample. (or 'win32/out/samples/db1/db1.exe' on Windows platforms).

8. API Documentation

The header files in 'include/ham' have extensive comments. Also, a doxygen
script is available; run 'make doc' to start doxygen. The generated
documentation is also available on the hamsterdb web page.

9. Other Ways to Compile hamsterdb Embedded Storage

If you want to compile hamsterdb without using the provided ./configure
environment, you have to set some preprocessor macros:

DEBUG                   enable debugging output and diagnostic checks (slow!)
HAM_LITTLE_ENDIAN       compile for little endian machines (i.e. x86)
HAM_BIG_ENDIAN          compile for big endian machines (most other
                        architectures)
HAM_32BIT               compile for 32bit (alias: WIN32)
HAM_64BIT               compile for 64bit (alias: WIN64, also needs WIN32)
HAM_DISABLE_COMPRESSION build without support for zlib compression
HAM_DISABLE_ENCRYPTION  build without support for AES encryption

Also, if you compile for windows, you have to compile the file 'src/os_win32.c',
and ignore the file 'src/os_posix.c'. Vice versa on non-Windows platforms.

10. Porting hamsterdb Embedded Storage

Porting hamsterdb Embedded Storage shouldn't be too difficult. All operating
system dependend functions are declared in 'src/os.h' and defined
in 'src/os_win32.c' or 'src/os_posix.c'.
Other compiler- and OS-specific macros are in 'include/ham/types.h'.
Most likely, these are the only files which have to be touched. Also see item
9) for important macros.

11. Licensing

hamsterdb Embedded Storage can be licensed on a per-developer basis for
closed source applications. For more details, see
http://hamsterdb.com/licensing and http://hamsterdb.com/store.

hamsterdb Embedded Storage is released under GPL2 or later. There are several
exceptions for other open source licenses (see
http://hamsterdb.com/licensing/exceptions for legal information and a license
list).
