   WARNING: some systems have 'int' returning signal handlers, others
   have 'void' returning signal handlers. Since the ones, which expect
   a 'void' return type, will silently ignore the return value
   at run-time anyhow, we can keep things simple here and just
   specify 'int'.

   However, this will cause a set of compiler warnings to appear;
   which will be compiler _errors_ when we're compiling the setup
   code in C++ mode; hence the forced use of an 'extern "C"'
   setup function for this; see the internals in main.cpp...

   The 'subcode' is in the arg list for the SIGFPE handler.
