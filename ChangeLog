    libboost_thread.lib) (thanks, foxb)
o issue #6: fixed compilation error in OSX Lion
o fixed HAM_INTERNAL_ERROR when creating database with
    HAM_ENABLE_RECOVERY but without HAM_ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS (thanks, Peter)

Apr 23, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o configure.in now checking for pread and pwrite (for some reason the
    previous test were missing)
o fixed fsync's when flushing to disk, making recovery more robust

Apr 22, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------

Apr 14, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o hamsterdb is now thread safe. The boost c++ library is now required for
    building

Mar 14, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o enabled approx matching for ham_cursor_find

Mar 11, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o hamsterdb is now thread-safe

Feb 18, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-2.0.1

Feb 15, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o ham_find() now supports approximate matching w/ transactions enabled

Feb 07, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o fixed bug where HAM_ONLY_DUPLICATES was ignored when used in a
    Transaction (thanks, Mark Ruijter from lessfs)

Feb 06, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o added a public macro HAM_API_REVISION to allow users to programmatically
    distinguish between new and old interface of ham_txn_begin
o win32: fixed build issue if HAM_DISABLE_COMPRESSION is defined (thanks,
    Andy Thalmann (http://www.softdev.ch))

Feb 05, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o the device structure (ham_device_t) was C++-ified; if you use
    ham_env_set_device then you will have to change your code
o fixed wrong version check when loading databases from 1.1.x
o now using the native Win32 API for os_pwrite and os_pread (thanks,
    Andy Thalmann (http://www.softdev.ch))
o added new parameter HAM_PARAM_LOG_DIRECTORY to specify the directory

Jan 19, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-2.0.0
o Changed interface ham_txn_begin, also for Wrapper APIs

Jan 05, 2012 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o when recovery or transactions are enabled then for most operations the
    physical log is no longer required; this reduces I/O and improves
    performance

Dec 14, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o dotnet: integrated the files, updated the interface

Dec 11, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o java: integrated the files, updated the interface
o wince: moved to /contrib directory

Nov 26, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-2.0.0rc3

Nov 20, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o improved performance for duplicates, transactions and cursors

Nov 10, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o fixed the remaining 3 known issues after lots of refactoring

Oct 11, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-2.0.0rc2

Oct 09, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o fixed a bug when erasing extended keys; sometimes this would try to
    load extended keys which do not exist (thanks, Andi Weber)

Oct 02, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o added a new function ham_cursor_get_record_size; retrieves the record
    size of the current item

Sep 27, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o the cache size is now 64bit, allowing caches > 4 GB

Aug 25, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o configure.in: AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE requests now version 1.10 (thanks, Ger)
o enabled large file support for 32bit linux (thanks, liheyuan)

Jul 25, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-2.0.0rc1

Jun 02, 2011 - chris
o the ./configure switch --enable-internal is now obsolte and enabled by
    default

Apr 18, 2011 - chris
o HAM_SORT_DUPLICATES is now disabled if Transactions are enabled.
    In such cases hamsterdb will return HAM_INV_PARAMETER.

Dec 29, 2010 - chris
o Approx. matching is now disabled if Transactions are enabled.
    In such cases functions will return HAM_INV_PARAMETER.
o Direct access (HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS) is now disabled if Transactions are
    enabled. In such cases functions will return HAM_INV_PARAMETER.
    In previous versions Direct Access was anyway not possible in combination
    with Transactions, because Transactions were not possible with In-Memory
    Databases.

Dec 27, 2010 - chris
o when using HAM_PARTIAL in combination with Transactions, HAM_INV_PARAMETER
    is now returned. In previous versions of hamsterdb, this combination was
    allowed. If you need this implemented then please tell me.

Dec 26, 2010 - chris
o when using HAM_PARTIAL and the record->size is <= 8 then error
    HAM_INV_PARAMETER is returned. In previous versions, this combination
    returned false results. Reason is because hamsterdb uses a compressed,
    efficient storage for such records, and they do not support partial
    access.

Sep 15, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.6


Oct 11, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-2.0.0rc2

Oct 09, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------

Aug 25, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o configure.in: AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE requests now version 1.10 (thanks, Ger)
o enabled large file support for 32bit linux (thanks, liheyuan)

Jul 25, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-2.0.0rc1

Jun 02, 2011 - chris
o the ./configure switch --enable-internal is now obsolte and enabled by
    default

Apr 18, 2011 - chris
o HAM_SORT_DUPLICATES is now disabled if Transactions are enabled.
    In such cases hamsterdb will return HAM_INV_PARAMETER.

Dec 29, 2010 - chris
o Approx. matching is now disabled if Transactions are enabled.
    In such cases functions will return HAM_INV_PARAMETER.
o Direct access (HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS) is now disabled if Transactions are
    enabled. In such cases functions will return HAM_INV_PARAMETER.
    In previous versions Direct Access was anyway not possible in combination
    with Transactions, because Transactions were not possible with In-Memory
    Databases.

o when using HAM_PARTIAL in combination with Transactions, HAM_INV_PARAMETER
    is now returned. In previous versions of hamsterdb, this combination was
    allowed. If you need this implemented then please tell me.

Sep 15, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.6


Jul 01, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.12

Jul 01, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o exported two internal functions as test gateways: ham_env_get_device
    and ham_env_set_allocator (in ham/hamsterdb_int.h)

Jul 01, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o bugfix: there was still a problem in the cache purge algorithm, and the
    memory consumption passed the cache boundaries. (Thanks, Jake)

Jun 30, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.11

Jun 27, 2011 - chris
o fixed a performance regression - when Transactions are enabled, the file
    was frequently flushed via fsync() even if HAM_WRITE_THROUGH was not
    set (thanks, Jake and Colm)

Jun 26, 2011 - chris
o the ./configure switch --enable-internal is now obsolte and enabled by
    default

Jun 20, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.10

Jun 18, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o the flag HAM_WRITE_THROUGH will now cause an immediate flush of all file
    handles to disk (via fdatasync or fsync, if fdatasync is not available,
    or FlushFileHandle on win32) if recovery (or Transactions) are enabled.
    This causes a noticable performance hit if you have many short-running
    Transactions, but it improves the durability in case the hardware
    crashes (a normal application segfault is not problematic because in
    such a case the operating system buffers are still flushed to disk).

May 25, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o the cachesize is now more respected than before; while earlier releases
    frequently exceeded the cache when necessary, hamsterdb will now try to
    remain in the cache boundaries as good as possible

May 13, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o added tools/ham_log - a tool to dump logfiles
o added tools/ham_recover - a tool to recover broken databases

Apr 28, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o bugfix: when ham_open[_ex] or ham_env_open[_ex] return HAM_NEED_RECOVERY
    these functions deleted the logfiles by mistake. Fixed, and added
    a unittest to avoid regressions

Apr 27, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o bugfix: after SMOs which affect the root page (i.e. a new root page is
    created) the header page is sometimes not written to the log file. This
    can cause data loss after recovery (Thanks, Mark)

Apr 15, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o bugfix: the cache was not purged correctly, thus grew uncontrolled
    (Thanks, Mark)

Mar 31, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o bugfix: the hamzilla server always failed to read the configuration file
    because of a wrong error check (Thanks, Sebastien)

Mar 28, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o bugfix: when opening a database, and recovery is enabled, the 'threshold'
    of the log files (which decides about the log file switching) was not
    initialized correctly. (Thanks, Jake Sloan)

Feb 03, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.9

Feb 02, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o added hamsterdb.spec to generate RPM files (thanks, John Gunkel)

Jan 28, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o linux 64bit: when having long-running transactions with very big
    databases (200 GB), and the working set of mmapped memory gets too big,
    mmap will fail and return ENOMEM. In this case, hamsterdb now falls
    back to malloc/read.

Jan 25, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o merged bugfix from branch bleeding_edge: on 64bit windows, the remote
    handles returned by the server were broken

Jan 24, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o several smaller fixes based on static code analysis

Jan 10, 2011 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o removed two wrong asserts and improved the fix of Nov 25th

Dec 05, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.8

Dec 03, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o configure.in will no longer overwrite -Ox flags; the default
    compilation option is now -O2 (thanks, Mark)

Nov 30, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o bugfix with HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS and cursors which insert duplicates at the
    beginning of the duplicate list; if record size is <= 8 bytes then
    invalid data was returned

Nov 25, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o bugfix in transaction handling - in certain cases with long running
    transactions, a circular reference in a linked list causes an endless
    loop (thanks, Mark)

Oct 31, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.7

Oct 22, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o further enhanced performance by improving some cache interfaces

Oct 20, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o enhanced performance when appending (or prepending) keys; hamsterdb
    will automatically assume HAM_HINT_APPEND (or HAM_HINT_PREPEND) if the
    previous operation was also an append (or prepend)

Oct 16, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o fixed a small memory leak when committing remote transactions
o bugfix: using HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS with records of a length <= 8 bytes
    returned pointers to temporary copies of the record and not to the
    original data (thanks, Lionel)

Oct 14, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o another important performance improvements when using hamsterdb with
    extended keys

Oct 13, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
o performance improvements - hamsterdb scales now better with millions
    of keys

Sep 15, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.6

Sep 12, 2010 - chris
o the unix daemon was ported to a Win32 Service (which can also run in
    foreground)

Sep 07, 2010 - chris
o the tutorial is no longer part of the Doxygen files; instead it's now
    online in a wiki: http://wiki.github.com/cruppstahl/hamsterdb
o several functions are now deprecated:
    use ham_open_ex instead of ham_open
    use ham_create_ex instead of ham_create
    use ham_env_open_ex instead of ham_env_open
    use ham_env_create_ex instead of ham_env_create

Aug 31, 2010 - chris
o fixed compilation on newest ArchLinux (gcc 4.5.1) - thanks, zebul666

Aug 28, 2010 - chris
o created MSVC projects for the server and the new samples; all MSVC
        projects and workspaces were updated to Visual Studio 2009

Aug 26, 2010 - chris
o ham_flush is now deprecated, use ham_env_flush instead; both functions
    had very similar functionality

Aug 25, 2010 - chris
o renamed ham/hamserver.h to ham/hamsterdb_srv.h; all symbols were renamed
    from hamserver_XXX to ham_srv_XXX
o removed the dependency to protobuf-c; now directly using google's protobuf
    (for C++)

Aug 11, 2010 - chris
o improved the documentation in hamsterdb.h

Aug 11, 2010 - chris
o added a unix daemon (tools/hamsrvd.c) which can serve multiple Environments.
    configuration is read from a json file (a sample configuration is
    included in tools/example.config)

Aug 10, 2010 - chris
o the server can now write access logfiles and error logfiles; the
    hamserver_config_t structure was modified

Aug 09, 2010 - chris
o fixed a few memory leaks in remote handling

Aug 04, 2010 - chris
o improved hamserver.h documentation; also, all functions in hamserver.h
    no longer return bool but a proper status value

Aug 03, 2010 - chris
o fixed approximate matching over remote connections - the keys were
    not propagated back to the client
o some parameters (HAM_PARAM_DATABASE_NAME, HAM_PARAM_KEYSIZE)
    were not propagated to remote servers when calling ham_get_parameters
    on a remote Database - fixed
o the extended parameters (ham_parameter_t) of ham_env_create_db were
    ignored when operating on a remote Environment - fixed

Aug 02, 2010 - chris
o added a new sample client1.c which can communicate with server1.c

Aug 02, 2010 - chris
o the source repository is now hosted at
    http://github.com/cruppstahl/hamsterdb. The old subversion repository
    is no longer available.

Jul 24, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.5

Jul 15, 2010 - chris
o finalized the client/server communication; hamsterdb is now able to
    access remote servers. A new header file hamserver.h was added.

Jul 02, 2010 - chris
o HAM_PARAM_GET_STATISTICS was moved to hamsterdb_int.h
o a new sample "server1" was added

Apr 29, 2010 - chris
o ham_env_get_parameters and ham_get_parameters do no longer accept
    NULL pointers as the first parameter; instead, they will fail with
    HAM_INV_PARAMETER

Apr 22, 2010 - chris
o Fixed compilation for MacOSX SnowLeopard (thanks, Olisa)

Apr 13, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.4

Apr 10, 2010 - chris
o The documentation in the header file was improved and some constants
    were renamed/deprecated

Apr 10, 2010 - chris
o Bugfix - win32 only: with very big databases and unlimited cache, resources
    were exceeded and mmap failed. in this case we'll now fall back to
    read/write (thanks, Simon)

Mar 27, 2010 - chris
o Bugfix - it was allowed to create temp. Transactions while a non-temp.
    Transaction was still active

Mar 18, 2010 - chris
o Optimization - if HAM_DAM_SEQUENTIAL_INSERT is set then btree nodes will
    not be split in the middle, but at the end of the node. hamsterdb will
    also auto-recognize if an insert is sequential (at the "right end" of
    the index). This leads to MUCH smaller files and therefore higher
    performance (thanks, Simon)

Mar 10, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.3

Mar 10, 2010 - chris
o Bugfix - fixed an invalid read of 3 bytes in the freelist

Mar 07, 2010 - chris
o Implemented partial read/write - records can now be read or written
    partially (see flag HAM_PARTIAL for ham_find, ham_insert and others)
    This new feature caused a change to ham_record_t, thus making the ABI
    of hamsterdb incompatible to older versions. This feature is test-covered
    by nearly 900 unittests.

Feb 27, 2010 - chris
o Bugfix - ham_get_parameter failed if database was opened read-only
    (thanks, Austin)

Feb 18, 2010 - chris
o Bugfix - if a cachesize was specified then it was not propagated correctly
    and ignored; this bugfix caused serious performance improvements compared
    to 1.1.2!

Feb 16, 2010 - chris
o Windows library and dll are now renamed to libhamsterdb-<version>.lib and
    hamsterdb-<version>.dll

Feb 11, 2010 - chris
o Added a new function to get the Environment handle of a Database
    (ham_get_env)

Feb 10, 2010 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.2

Feb 07, 2010 - chris
o Added documentation target; there's now one target for public documentation,
    one for internal and one for BFC (unittest framework) - thanks, Ger
o Finished a lot of refactoring - some from Ger, some from me

Feb 03, 2010 - chris
o Added comment in hamsterdb_int.h and hamsterdb_stats.h - these files describe
    internal interfaces! unlike hamsterdb.h they are never stable and can
    be changed with every new version.

Feb 01, 2010 - chris
o Bugfix: if multiple databases in an Environment are open, and just one
    Database is closed, then the pages of this Database were not flushed
    correctly
o Bugfix: if multiple databases in an Environment are open, an open Transaction
    was not immediately closed on the first call of ham_close

Jan 19, 2010 - chris
o duplicate keys can now be sorted. The default sort order is based on
    memcmp(), but can be overwritten with ham_set_duplicate_compare_func.

Jan 15, 2010 - chris
o fixed crash on Linux 64bit/gcc 4.4.1 caused by some statements which broke
    compiler optimization

Jan 14, 2010 - chris
o fixed compiler problems with g++ 4.4.x in the unittests (some header files
    were missing)

Jan 09, 2010 - chris
o bugfix in unittest - HamsterdbTest::nearFindTest fails if internal
    functions are disabled (thanks, Austin!)

Jan 06, 2010 - chris
o added safety checks to prevent reuse of a ham_db_t or ham_env_t
    structure which is already in use (thanks, Ger!)
o the implementation of ham_create[_ex] and ham_open[_ex] was rewritten:
    both functions now create their private Environment handle. This
    simplifies lots of code.

Dec 23, 2009 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.1

Dec 19, 2009 - chris
o the flag HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS can return a pointer in hamsterdb's managed
    storage (only In-Memory Databases!)
o the flag HAM_HINT_UBER_FAST_ACCESS for ham_get_key_count was
    renamed to HAM_FAST_ESTIMATE
o removed HAM_HINT_SEQUENTIAL and HAM_HINT_RANDOM_WRITE and
    HAM_HINT_UBER_FAST_ACCESS - they have the same use as the DAM flags;
    sorry for the inconvenience. If you used them, just remove them

Dec 16, 2009 - chris
o improved tests of HAM_HINTS_* flags and fixed some bugs in the
    process - mainly asserts which failed because the flags were unexpected

Dec 15, 2009 - chris
o ham_get_parameter now returns the Data Access Mode (DAM)
o renamed HAM_EMPTY_DATABASE_NAME to HAM_DEFAULT_DATABASE_NAME

Dec 14, 2009 - chris
o fixed bug in ham_find - if record was empty, but record->size was set
    by the caller, then the record->size value was not overwritten
    with zero
o fixed compilation error if HAM_DISABLE_ENCRYPTION was set
o fixed ham_check_integrity - sometimes returned errors although the
    database was fine

Dec 12, 2009 - chris
o html documentation is now part of the tarball

Dec 03, 2009 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.0

Nov 28, 2009 - chris
o Disallowed pagesizes which are not aligned to 2k (with exception of 1k);
    allowed pagesizes are now 1k, 2k, 4k, 6k, 8k etc

Nov 9, 2009 - chris
o C++ API now has all the new functions
o ham_get_flags is now deprecated - it was replaced by ham_get_parameters
    and ham_env_get_parameters
o the flag HAM_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE is now enabled by default
o the new function ham_get_key_count() returns number of all keys in the
    Database

Jul 31, 2009 - chris
o performance improvements in the freelist code, freelist was abstracted
    to allow multiple implementations (all from Ger Hobbelt,
    http://www.hobbelt.com, http://www.hebbut.net)
o added "Data Access Mode" to give hints how Databases/Environments are used;

Jul 25, 2009 - chris
o bugfix: when an Environment is created (or opened), the header page was
    not immediately written (or read); therefore settings were lost, unless
    a database was created (or opened) - Thanks, Ger Hobbelt

Jul 20, 2009 - chris
o added ham_env_get_parameters, ham_db_get_parameters and
    functions for approximate matching (all from Ger Hobbelt,

    test framework)

May 12, 2009 - chris
o fixed segmentation fault when using a Cursor to iterate over all keys
    and the record parameter is NULL and compression is enabled, then
    hamsterdb tried to compress the NULL record (thanks, Jiezg)

Jun 27, 2008 - chris
o Implemented the first of several milestones with Transaction support;
    please see the README for details about the limitations, some of them
    are quite severe

Jun 16, 2008 - chris
o Bugfix: when creating several Databases in an Environment, and recovery
    was enabled, each Database created its own log object and the log
    was corrupted

Jun 03, 2008 - chris
o Fixed typo in hamsterdb.h documentation - HAM_INV_LOG_FILE_HEADER is
    actually called HAM_LOG_INV_FILE_HEADER

May 25, 2008 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.0.3

May 24, 2008 - chris

May 21, 2008 - chris
o Finalized the implementation of logging and recovery; can be enabled with
    HAM_ENABLE_RECOVERY

May 10, 2008 - chris
o The flag HAM_DISABLE_FREELIST_FLUSH is now deprecated; freelist operations

May 10, 2008 - chris
o minor documentation fixes (mainly grammar releated) in ham/hamsterdb.h

May 09, 2008 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.0.2

May 06, 2008 - chris
o added new API function ham_get_flags()

May 06, 2008 - chris
o When creating an environment with ham_env_create_ex and a custom
    page size, the page size was not stored correctly
o An assert was sometimes triggered when closing a Database which was part
    of an Environment

Apr 25, 2008 - chris
o bugfix: when a cursor is overwritten (ham_cursor_overwrite), the modified
    page was never released from the cache

Mar 09, 2008 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.0.1

Feb 19, 2008 - chris
o added a macro HAM_CALLCONV to set the calling convention; per default,
    it's empty and therefore CDECL is used

Feb 10, 2008 - chris
o added a new internal function ham_cursor_get_database

Jan 25, 2008 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.0.0

Jan 24, 2008 - chris

    functions

Jan 08, 2008 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.0.0rc1

Jan 08, 2008 - chris
o bugfix: when inserting with ham_cursor_insert, but the insert fails (i.e.
    because the key already exists), the cursor is modified and uninitialized,
    but it should still point to the same element as before the operation

Jan 06, 2008 - chris
o bugfix: when uncoupling a cursor, sometimes the connection between page
    and cursor was broken

Jan 02, 2008 - chris
o API change for ham_env_close: if you call ham_env_close and there are still
    open Databases, the function will no longer fail with HAM_ENV_NOT_EMPTY;
    instead, the Databases are closed with ham_close; you still have to
    close the Cursors of each Database, though.
o API change for ham_close: if you call ham_close and there are still
    open Cursors, the function will no longer fail with HAM_DB_NOT_EMPTY;
    instead, the Cursors are invalidated, but you still have to call
    ham_cursor_close to prevent memory leaks. Alternatively, the flag
    HAM_AUTO_CLEANUP implicitely calls ham_cursor_close on each function.

Jan 01, 2008 - chris
o calling ham_set_prefix_compare_func with NULL as a function pointer
    does no longer set the default prefix compare function, but completely
    disables prefix comparison

Dec 31, 2007 - chris
o Most errors now emit a ham_trace debug messages, esp. HAM_INV_PARAMETER;
    also, in release mode all messages now show the hamsterdb function name,
    and in debug mode they show the hamsterdb source filename/line number

Dec 30, 2007 - chris
o The debug- and error-messages are now always compiled; the message handler
    of the debug build prints all messages, the handler of the release build
    ignores debug messages

Dec 29, 2007 - chris
o Removed the function ham_dump; it was replaced by the command line tool
    and is no longer necessary

Dec 20, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.9

Dec 19, 2007 - chris
o Fixes in the MSVC Solution for Win64; the types (include/ham/types.h)
    were not set correctly to 64bit values

Dec 17, 2007 - chris
o SPARC fixes: several minor changes to avoid unaligned memory access,
    especially with duplicate keys and extended keys; hamsterdb
    should now run fine on SPARC

Dec 14, 2007 - chris
o configure: don't use lock_exclusive on Solaris (fails on SunOS 5.9)

Dec 06, 2007 - chris
o added two tools: ham_dump (for dumping a database) and ham_info
    (for printing statistics)

Dec 03, 2007 - chris
o bugfix for SPARC: fixed an unaligned access when assigning record numbers
o bugfix for Windows x64: the offset of a memory mapped access was sometimes
    not calculated correctly

Nov 24, 2007 - chris
o added small performance improvements and fixes in the zlib-based
    compression-filter

Nov 15, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.8

Nov 14, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: the parameters for memory mapped I/O on win32 did not create
    private copies and therefore the file could be damaged if an operation
    aborted

Nov 10, 2007 - chris
o Environments now support a configurable number of databases; the default
    is 16, but files with a pagesize of 16kb can have up to 508 databases.
    See parameter HAM_PARAM_MAX_ENV_DATABASES for ham_env_create_ex.

Nov 09, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: when deleting a database from an Environment (ham_env_erase_db),
    the database name was not removed

Nov 06, 2007 - chris
o added a new function ham_env_get_database_names(), which returns all
    database names in an environment.

Nov 01, 2007 - chris
o implemented zlib-based compression; a new function was added:
    ham_enable_compression()
o added a new option --disable-compression for configure; this option does not
    compile/link ham_enable_compression.

Nov 01, 2007 - chris
o added generic record filters - ham_add_record_filter and
    ham_remove_record_filter
o added a new option --disable-encryption for configure; this option does not
    compile/link ham_env_enable_encryption.

Oct 28, 2007 - chris
o implemented AES encryption; a new function was added:
    ham_env_enable_encryption()
o fixed bug in configure.in; on some systems, the call to getpagesize()
    was not declared correctly. i hope it works now.

Oct 26, 2007 - chris
o finished the C++ API in include/ham/hamsterdb.hpp and added two new C++
    samples - db6.cpp and env3.cpp.

Oct 21, 2007 - chris
o added generic page filters - ham_env_add_page_filter and
    ham_env_remove_page_filter

Oct 18, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: when moving a cursor through duplicates and the cache was
    exhausted, an assert was triggered - fixed

Oct 16, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: ham_close in an environment could lead to a segmentation fault,
    because the cache for extended keys was not properly set up, before
    it was deleted

Oct 11, 2007 - chris
o the default pagesize for unix databases is now 16kb, not 4kb; benchmarks
    show that this is the fastest option, but still results in small files

Oct 10, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.7

Oct 09, 2007 - chris
o restructured the wince MSV8 solution and project files

Oct 08, 2007 - chris
o completely recreated the win32 MSVC8 solution and project files

Oct 05, 2007 - chris
o added function ham_cursor_get_duplicate_count
o fixed a bug in coupling an uncoupling cursor: the duplicate id was lost
o added a new sample env2.c, which demonstrates a 1:n relationship for
    two tables (with the use of duplicate keys)

Oct 04, 2007 - chris
o record numbers are now no longer reused after they were deleted and the
    database was reopened.

Oct 03, 2007 - chris
o rewrote some blob management routines which resulted in an improvement
    of duplicate keys.

Oct 02, 2007 - chris
o the freelist routines were completely rewritten and are much faster now.

Oct 01, 2007 - chris
o it's now enough to initialize a ham_key_t and ham_record_t once in the
    beginning, and not before every use. also added some checks and
    errors when using an uninitialized structure.

Sep 30, 2007 - chris
o ham_env_close now expects a second parameter for flags; you can specify the
    flag HAM_AUTO_CLOSE, and all open databases are closed automatically.
    if the flag is not specified, but cursors are still open, ham_env_close
    fails and returns HAM_ENV_NOT_EMPTY.
o ham_close now expects a second parameter for flags; you can specify the
    flag HAM_AUTO_CLOSE, and all open cursors are closed automatically.
    if the flag is not specified, but cursors are still open, ham_close
    fails and returns HAM_DB_NOT_EMPTY.

Sep 27, 2007 - chris
o fixed a bug in the freelist - the dirty-flag was not set, when an overflow
    page was allocated; if the cache was exhausted, freelist pages could
    get lost, and the file would grow very fast.

Sep 24, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.6

Sep 24, 2007 - chris
o support for duplicate items is finally finished, and a new sample
    (db5.c) was added

Sep 13, 2007 - chris
o fixed big endian-bugs in record number databases (ham_find, ham_erase
    and ham_cursor_find did not convert the record number to db-endian)

Aug 31, 2007 - chris
o renamed ham_cursor_replace to ham_cursor_overwrite (to be consistent with
    the flag HAM_OVERWRITE)

Aug 30, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: if a cursor pointed to an item, but this item was erased (either
    with another cursor or ham_erase), the dangling pointer was not updated,
    and a subsequent access would result in undefined behaviour - fixed.

Aug 24, 2007 - chris
o overwriting record number keys was not possible because a new (incremented)
    recno key was assigned even if the flag HAM_OVERWRITE was specified.
    fixed - recno keys can now be overwritten

Aug 09, 2007 - chris
o hamsterdb is now released under GPL 2 *or any later version*, which also
    includes GPL 3.

Aug 08, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.5

Aug 08, 2007 - chris
o fixed CreateFile calls on win32 - call CreateFileW if UNICODE is defined,
    otherwise call CreateFileA

Aug 04, 2007 - chris
o fixed HAM_READ_ONLY support for win32 - the file handle is now created
    with GENERIC_READ, not GENERIC_READ|GENERIC_WRITE

Aug 03, 2007 - chris
o finalized support for record numbers
o added a sample for record numbers (samples/db4.c)

Aug 01, 2007 - chris
o removed status codes HAM_SHORT_READ and HAM_SHORT_WRITE; instead,
    HAM_IO_ERROR is now used
o ham_flush() now also flushes the header page (so far the header page was
    forgotten under certain circumstances)
o set the DB_CHUNKSIZE (which is the minimum size of a freelist entry) to
    32 instead of 64; generated database files are much smaller now

Jul 22, 2007 - chris
o when opening an environment file with ham_open (as a database), the first
    database in the environment is now opened

Jul 21, 2007 - chris
o when opening an environment, the flags were not stored
o don't allow ham_env_create_db if the environment was opened r/o
o calling ham_set_prefix_compare_func and ham_set_compare_func with NULL
    as second parameter resets the compare function to the default
    compare function (based on memcmp)
o bugfix: failed to open environments, which were created with a
    different pagesize than the default pagesize; fixed

Jul 19, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: if a ham_db_t handle was reused after ham_close, an internal
    pointer was not set to NULL, which resulted in a segfault
o replaced error code HAM_INV_INDEX with HAM_NOT_INITIALIZED
o replaced error code HAM_ENV_FULL with HAM_LIMITS_REACHED

Jun 15, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.4

Jul 13, 2007 - chris
o finalized "environment" functions, APIs and unittests; added a new sample
    (samples/env1.c).

Jul 06, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: freelist pages were not marked as dirty, and therefore
    sometimes weren't written to disk

Jul 03, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: deleted pages (with db_free_page()) were not moved to the
    freelist, and zombie pages were created

Jun 24, 2007 - chris
o finished the port to Windows CE. Solution files are in the wince
    directory (configured for STANDARDSDK 5.0 (x86)). See wince/README.TXT
    for the details.

Jun 20, 2007 - chris
o improved the caching of extended keys; the cache is now purged when it's
    too full

Jun 17, 2007 - chris
o added the flag HAM_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE; will lock the file exclusively, as
    long as it's open. Returns HAM_WOULD_BLOCK if you try to place an
    exclusive lock on a database which was already opened exclusively.

Jun 15, 2007 - chris
o fixed a bug which disabled HAM_DISABLE_MMAP; even if the flag was
    specified, mmap routines were used

Jun 12, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.3

Jun 11, 2007 - chris
o unittests work now on big-endian machines

Jun 10, 2007 - chris
o fixed a small memory leak (in-memory db only, when using extended keys
    and a lot of SMOs occur, because many keys are deleted)

Jun 04, 2007 - chris
o fixed configure.in - do not build unittests if cppunit is not
    installed

May 30, 2007 - chris
o added unittests for util.c
o modified doxygen tags in the documentation (ham/hamsterdb.h)
o fixed a rare memory leak with SMOs during ham_erase
    (only for in-memory databases)

May 29, 2007 - chris

May 19, 2007 - chris
o configure.in now checks for cppunit/extensions/HelperMacros.h, not
    cppunit/TestSuite.h

May 10, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.2

May 10, 2007 - chris
o refactored the freelist and reimplemented it as a bitmap
o removed HAM_OPTIMIZE_SIZE - this flag is no longer needed, the new bitmap
    structures are automatically optimized

May 5, 2007 - chris
o new unittests for the freelist

Apr 04, 2007 - chris
o refactored the cache and some other modules
o bugfix in ham_open_ex: the cachesize parameter was ignored; ham_open_ex
    always used HAM_DEFAULT_CACHESIZE

Apr 02, 2007 - chris
o started writing unittests and refactoring

Mar 27, 2007 - chris
o database files are now endian-agnostic; hamsterdb can now use big-endian
    databases on little-endian architectures and vice versa

Mar 21, 2007 - chris
o removed HAM_OPEN_EXCLUSIVELY - i'll replace it with file locking in a
    few weeks
o use mmap if the db-pagesize is a multiple of the os-pagesize, and not
    just if it's equal
o do not store the following flags in the database: HAM_DISABLE_VAR_KEYLEN,
    HAM_CACHE_STRICT, HAM_DISABLE_MMAP, HAM_OPEN_EXCLUSIVELY,
    HAM_WRITE_THROUGH, HAM_READ_ONLY, HAM_OPTIMIZE_SIZE,
    HAM_DISABLE_FREELIST_FLUSH
o fixed an unlikely crash in ham_cursor_move: if the cursor was nil after
    moving the cursor, return an error

Mar 17, 2007 - chris
o added configure-option --enable-internal to enable all internal
    functions (ham_dump and ham_check_integrity). disabling those functions
    shrinks the library size by a few kilobytes
o improved the documentation in the header-files

Mar 16, 2007 - chris
o improved configure.in - added --enable-shrink, removed optimizations
    for --enable-debug, all other modes will now use -O3

Mar 06, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.1

Mar 04, 2007
o moved the ./tests-subdirectory to a separate repository

Mar 03, 2007
o win32 compiles and links as a static or dynamic library with Visual C++
    2005 Express Edition; testes are all successful

Feb 11, 2007
o many small changes to compile everything on cygwin

Feb 04, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.0

Feb 03, 2007 - chris
o all write-functions return an error if they're called but the
    database is in read-only mode
o added a new sample db3.c, which reads words from stdin and prints them
    in sorted order
o removed the flag HAM_OPEN_CREATE; it was broken anyway

Feb 02, 2007 - chris
o database cursors are now fully implemented and tested

Jan 24, 2007 - chris
o default behaviour for ham_create changed; already existing files are now
    overwritten
o now uses -Wall on platforms with gcc
o resized the default cache size from 128kb to 256kb

Jan 23, 2007 - chris
o added a new sample db2.c, which copies an existing database to another
    database using a cursor.

Jan 21, 2007 - chris
o the cursor implementation is finished and seems to work; testing is not
    yet complete.
o ham_flush now has an (unused) flags-parameter.
o renamed samples/simple.c to samples/db1.c

Jan 20, 2007 - chris
o created one global transaction-pointer in the database object, and
    removed all transaction parameters for most functions; added tests that
    only one single transaction object is created.

Dec 23, 2006 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.3.1

Dec 23, 2006 - chris
o header-files are now installed to $prefix/include/ham
o test is not build if db.h is missing

Dec 19, 2006 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.3

Dec 15, 2006 - chris
o started the port to MS Windows; so far, there are only two batch
    files to create the library, but no nmake file or Visual Studio
    project.
o started to move the stuff to automake/autoconf; transition is not
    yet complete

Dec 10, 2006 - chris
o a new parameter HAM_OPTIMIZE_SIZE creates smaller files by merging
    freelist entries (comes at a small performance penalty)

Nov 26, 2006 - chris
o extended keys are now cached (if the cache size is big enough)

Nov 24, 2006 - chris
o added HAM_DISABLE_FREELIST_FLUSH - when a freelist page is modified, it
    is no longer flushed immediately. this is dangerous - in case of a
    crash, the database is most likely broken.

Nov 23, 2006 - chris
o fixed a small leak - if records are overwritten, and the new record size
    is smaller then sizeof(ham_offset_t), the old blob was not added to
    the freelist

Nov 22, 2006 - chris
o completely rewrote the freelist - elements are now sorted, and access is
    a lot faster. also, elements are merged, if possible, which
    results in smaller files
o fixed a bug; if the root page is split, the address of the root page
    was not stored correctly in the database header

Nov 12, 2006 - chris
o completely rewrote the blob storage - blobs are now stored in one big
    chunk, and not splitted into pages
o replaced read/write with pread/pwrite
o fixed a small bug related to a performance improvement on Nov 5th
    (removed too many memset's...)

Nov 09, 2006 - chris
o fetching in-memory-blobs created a memory leak if the record data
    was allocated by the user

Nov 07, 2006 - chris
o blobs which were overwritten (and therefore were deleted) were not
    added to the freelist

Nov 05, 2006 - chris
o fixed a tiny memory leak in blob_erase
o replaced linear search in btree_get_slot and btree_insert with
    binary search, got significant performance improvements
o removed some unnecessary memsets, after allocating a new page
o relaxed the "minkey"-rule: after erasing, pages are now merged when
