Mar 10, 2010 - chris
o Bugfix - fixed an invalid read of 3 bytes in the freelist

Mar 07, 2010 - chris
o Implemented partial read/write - records can now be read or written 
    partially (see flag HAM_PARTIAL for ham_find, ham_insert and others)
    This new feature caused a change to ham_record_t, thus making the ABI
    of hamsterdb incompatible to older versions. This feature is test-covered
    by nearly 900 unittests.

Feb 27, 2010 - chris
o Bugfix - ham_get_parameter failed if database was opened read-only
    (thanks, Austin)

Feb 18, 2010 - chris
o Bugfix - if a cachesize was specified then it was not propagated correctly
    and ignored; this bugfix caused serious performance improvements compared
    to 1.1.2!

Feb 16, 2010 - chris
o Windows library and dll are now renamed to libhamsterdb-<version>.lib and
    hamsterdb-<version>.dll

Feb 11, 2010 - chris

                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.2

Feb 07, 2010 - chris
o Added documentation target; there's now one target for public documentation,
    one for internal and one for BFC (unittest framework) - thanks, Ger
o Finished a lot of refactoring - some from Ger, some from me

Feb 03, 2010 - chris
o Added comment in hamsterdb_int.h and hamsterdb_stats.h - these files describe
    internal interfaces! unlike hamsterdb.h they are never stable and can
    be changed with every new version.

Feb 01, 2010 - chris
o Bugfix: if multiple databases in an Environment are open, and just one 
    Database is closed, then the pages of this Database were not flushed
    correctly
o Bugfix: if multiple databases in an Environment are open, an open Transaction
    was not immediately closed on the first call of ham_close

Jan 19, 2010 - chris
o duplicate keys can now be sorted. The default sort order is based on 
    memcmp(), but can be overwritten with ham_set_duplicate_compare_func.

Jan 15, 2010 - chris
o fixed crash on Linux 64bit/gcc 4.4.1 caused by some statements which broke
    compiler optimization

Jan 14, 2010 - chris
o fixed compiler problems with g++ 4.4.x in the unittests (some header files
    were missing)

Jan 09, 2010 - chris
o bugfix in unittest - HamsterdbTest::nearFindTest fails if internal
    functions are disabled (thanks, Austin!)

Jan 06, 2010 - chris
o added safety checks to prevent reuse of a ham_db_t or ham_env_t 
	structure which is already in use (thanks, Ger!)
o the implementation of ham_create[_ex] and ham_open[_ex] was rewritten:
	both functions now create their private Environment handle. This 
	simplifies lots of code.

Dec 23, 2009 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.1

Dec 19, 2009 - chris
o the flag HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS can return a pointer in hamsterdb's managed
    storage (only In-Memory Databases!)
o the flag HAM_HINT_UBER_FAST_ACCESS for ham_get_key_count was 
	renamed to HAM_FAST_ESTIMATE
o removed HAM_HINT_SEQUENTIAL and HAM_HINT_RANDOM_WRITE and 
	HAM_HINT_UBER_FAST_ACCESS - they have the same use as the DAM flags; 
	sorry for the inconvenience. If you used them, just remove them

Dec 16, 2009 - chris
o improved tests of HAM_HINTS_* flags and fixed some bugs in the
    process - mainly asserts which failed because the flags were unexpected

Dec 15, 2009 - chris
o ham_get_parameter now returns the Data Access Mode (DAM)
o renamed HAM_EMPTY_DATABASE_NAME to HAM_DEFAULT_DATABASE_NAME

Dec 14, 2009 - chris

    by the caller, then the record->size value was not overwritten
    with zero
o fixed compilation error if HAM_DISABLE_ENCRYPTION was set
o fixed ham_check_integrity - sometimes returned errors although the
    database was fine

Dec 12, 2009 - chris
o html documentation is now part of the tarball

Dec 03, 2009 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.1.0

Nov 28, 2009 - chris

    to allow multiple implementations (all from Ger Hobbelt, 
    http://www.hobbelt.com, http://www.hebbut.net)
o added "Data Access Mode" to give hints how Databases/Environments are used;
    hamsterdb can then optimize its internal algorithms/file formats
    (all from Ger Hobbelt, http://www.hobbelt.com, http://www.hebbut.net)

Jul 26, 2009 - chris 
o the unittest framework "bfc" was improved significantly, allowing new
    command line options and catching HW and win32-exceptions (all from
    Ger Hobbelt, http://www.hobbelt.com, http://www.hebbut.net)

Jul 25, 2009 - chris 
o bugfix: when an Environment is created (or opened), the header page was
    not immediately written (or read); therefore settings were lost, unless
    a database was created (or opened) - Thanks, Ger Hobbelt

Jul 20, 2009 - chris 
o added ham_env_get_parameters, ham_db_get_parameters and
    functions for approximate matching (all from Ger Hobbelt, 
    http://www.hobbelt.com, http://www.hebbut.net)

Jul 19, 2009 - chris 
o added various new asserts, code cleanups, win32 improvements/security
    improvements and new tests (all from Ger Hobbelt, http://www.hobbelt.com,
    http://www.hebbut.net)
o added Approximate Matching - ham_find/ham_cursor_find can now return
	the nearest neighbour if the key is not found

o removed the dependency to cppunit (replaced it with my own tiny acceptance
    test framework)

May 12, 2009 - chris 
o fixed segmentation fault when using a Cursor to iterate over all keys
    and the record parameter is NULL and compression is enabled, then
    hamsterdb tried to compress the NULL record (thanks, Jiezg)

                      release of hamsterdb-1.0.4

Jun 27, 2008 - chris
o Implemented the first of several milestones with Transaction support;
    please see the README for details about the limitations, some of them
    are quite severe
    
Jun 16, 2008 - chris
o Bugfix: when creating several Databases in an Environment, and recovery
    was enabled, each Database created its own log object and the log
    was corrupted

Jun 03, 2008 - chris
o Fixed typo in hamsterdb.h documentation - HAM_INV_LOG_FILE_HEADER is
    actually called HAM_LOG_INV_FILE_HEADER

May 25, 2008 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.0.3

May 24, 2008 - chris

o Finalized the implementation of logging and recovery; can be enabled with
	HAM_ENABLE_RECOVERY

May 10, 2008 - chris

May 10, 2008 - chris
o minor documentation fixes (mainly grammar releated) in ham/hamsterdb.h

May 09, 2008 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.0.2

May 06, 2008 - chris
o added new API function ham_get_flags()

May 06, 2008 - chris
o When creating an environment with ham_env_create_ex and a custom
    page size, the page size was not stored correctly
o An assert was sometimes triggered when closing a Database which was part
    of an Environment

Apr 25, 2008 - chris

    page was never released from the cache

Mar 09, 2008 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.0.1

Feb 19, 2008 - chris
o added a macro HAM_CALLCONV to set the calling convention; per default, 
	it's empty and therefore CDECL is used

Feb 10, 2008 - chris
o added a new internal function ham_cursor_get_database

Jan 25, 2008 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.0.0

    functions

Jan 08, 2008 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-1.0.0rc1

Jan 08, 2008 - chris
o bugfix: when inserting with ham_cursor_insert, but the insert fails (i.e.
    because the key already exists), the cursor is modified and uninitialized,
    but it should still point to the same element as before the operation

Jan 06, 2008 - chris
o bugfix: when uncoupling a cursor, sometimes the connection between page
    and cursor was broken

Jan 02, 2008 - chris
o API change for ham_env_close: if you call ham_env_close and there are still
    open Databases, the function will no longer fail with HAM_ENV_NOT_EMPTY; 
    instead, the Databases are closed with ham_close; you still have to
    close the Cursors of each Database, though.
o API change for ham_close: if you call ham_close and there are still
    open Cursors, the function will no longer fail with HAM_DB_NOT_EMPTY; 
    instead, the Cursors are invalidated, but you still have to call 
    ham_cursor_close to prevent memory leaks. Alternatively, the flag
    HAM_AUTO_CLEANUP implicitely calls ham_cursor_close on each function.

Jan 01, 2008 - chris
o calling ham_set_prefix_compare_func with NULL as a function pointer
    does no longer set the default prefix compare function, but completely
    disables prefix comparison

Dec 31, 2007 - chris
o Most errors now emit a ham_trace debug messages, esp. HAM_INV_PARAMETER;
    also, in release mode all messages now show the hamsterdb function name,
    and in debug mode they show the hamsterdb source filename/line number

Dec 30, 2007 - chris
o The debug- and error-messages are now always compiled; the message handler
    of the debug build prints all messages, the handler of the release build
    ignores debug messages

Dec 29, 2007 - chris
o Removed the function ham_dump; it was replaced by the command line tool
    and is no longer necessary

Dec 20, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.9

Dec 19, 2007 - chris
o Fixes in the MSVC Solution for Win64; the types (include/ham/types.h)
    were not set correctly to 64bit values

Dec 17, 2007 - chris
o SPARC fixes: several minor changes to avoid unaligned memory access,
    especially with duplicate keys and extended keys; hamsterdb 
    should now run fine on SPARC

Dec 14, 2007 - chris
o configure: don't use lock_exclusive on Solaris (fails on SunOS 5.9)

Dec 06, 2007 - chris
o added two tools: ham_dump (for dumping a database) and ham_info
    (for printing statistics)

Dec 03, 2007 - chris
o bugfix for SPARC: fixed an unaligned access when assigning record numbers
o bugfix for Windows x64: the offset of a memory mapped access was sometimes
    not calculated correctly

Nov 24, 2007 - chris
o added small performance improvements and fixes in the zlib-based
    compression-filter

Nov 15, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.8

Nov 14, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: the parameters for memory mapped I/O on win32 did not create 
    private copies and therefore the file could be damaged if an operation
    aborted

Nov 10, 2007 - chris
o Environments now support a configurable number of databases; the default
    is 16, but files with a pagesize of 16kb can have up to 508 databases.
    See parameter HAM_PARAM_MAX_ENV_DATABASES for ham_env_create_ex.

Nov 09, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: when deleting a database from an Environment (ham_env_erase_db), 
    the database name was not removed

Nov 06, 2007 - chris
o added a new function ham_env_get_database_names(), which returns all 
	database names in an environment.

Nov 01, 2007 - chris
o implemented zlib-based compression; a new function was added:
    ham_enable_compression()
o added a new option --disable-compression for configure; this option does not
    compile/link ham_enable_compression.

Nov 01, 2007 - chris
o added generic record filters - ham_add_record_filter and 
    ham_remove_record_filter
o added a new option --disable-encryption for configure; this option does not
    compile/link ham_env_enable_encryption.

Oct 28, 2007 - chris
o implemented AES encryption; a new function was added: 
	ham_env_enable_encryption()
o fixed bug in configure.in; on some systems, the call to getpagesize()
    was not declared correctly. i hope it works now.

Oct 26, 2007 - chris
o finished the C++ API in include/ham/hamsterdb.hpp and added two new C++
	samples - db6.cpp and env3.cpp.

Oct 21, 2007 - chris
o added generic page filters - ham_env_add_page_filter and 
	ham_env_remove_page_filter

Oct 18, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: when moving a cursor through duplicates and the cache was
	exhausted, an assert was triggered - fixed

Oct 16, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: ham_close in an environment could lead to a segmentation fault, 
	because the cache for extended keys was not properly set up, before
	it was deleted

Oct 11, 2007 - chris
o the default pagesize for unix databases is now 16kb, not 4kb; benchmarks 
    show that this is the fastest option, but still results in small files

Oct 10, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.7

Oct 09, 2007 - chris

Oct 08, 2007 - chris
o completely recreated the win32 MSVC8 solution and project files

Oct 05, 2007 - chris
o added function ham_cursor_get_duplicate_count
o fixed a bug in coupling an uncoupling cursor: the duplicate id was lost
o added a new sample env2.c, which demonstrates a 1:n relationship for
    two tables (with the use of duplicate keys)

Oct 04, 2007 - chris
o record numbers are now no longer reused after they were deleted and the
    database was reopened.

Oct 03, 2007 - chris
o rewrote some blob management routines which resulted in an improvement
    of duplicate keys.

Oct 02, 2007 - chris
o the freelist routines were completely rewritten and are much faster now.

Oct 01, 2007 - chris
o it's now enough to initialize a ham_key_t and ham_record_t once in the
    beginning, and not before every use. also added some checks and 
    errors when using an uninitialized structure.

Sep 30, 2007 - chris
o ham_env_close now expects a second parameter for flags; you can specify the
    flag HAM_AUTO_CLOSE, and all open databases are closed automatically.
    if the flag is not specified, but cursors are still open, ham_env_close
    fails and returns HAM_ENV_NOT_EMPTY.
o ham_close now expects a second parameter for flags; you can specify the
    flag HAM_AUTO_CLOSE, and all open cursors are closed automatically.
    if the flag is not specified, but cursors are still open, ham_close
    fails and returns HAM_DB_NOT_EMPTY.

Sep 27, 2007 - chris
o fixed a bug in the freelist - the dirty-flag was not set, when an overflow
    page was allocated; if the cache was exhausted, freelist pages could
    get lost, and the file would grow very fast.

Sep 24, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.6

Sep 24, 2007 - chris
o support for duplicate items is finally finished, and a new sample 
    (db5.c) was added

Sep 13, 2007 - chris
o fixed big endian-bugs in record number databases (ham_find, ham_erase
    and ham_cursor_find did not convert the record number to db-endian)

Aug 31, 2007 - chris
o renamed ham_cursor_replace to ham_cursor_overwrite (to be consistent with
	the flag HAM_OVERWRITE)

Aug 30, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: if a cursor pointed to an item, but this item was erased (either
	with another cursor or ham_erase), the dangling pointer was not updated,
	and a subsequent access would result in undefined behaviour - fixed.

Aug 24, 2007 - chris
o overwriting record number keys was not possible because a new (incremented) 
    recno key was assigned even if the flag HAM_OVERWRITE was specified. 
    fixed - recno keys can now be overwritten

Aug 09, 2007 - chris
o hamsterdb is now released under GPL 2 *or any later version*, which also
	includes GPL 3.

Aug 08, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.5

Aug 08, 2007 - chris
o fixed CreateFile calls on win32 - call CreateFileW if UNICODE is defined,
    otherwise call CreateFileA

Aug 04, 2007 - chris
o fixed HAM_READ_ONLY support for win32 - the file handle is now created
    with GENERIC_READ, not GENERIC_READ|GENERIC_WRITE

Aug 03, 2007 - chris
o finalized support for record numbers
o added a sample for record numbers (samples/db4.c)

Aug 01, 2007 - chris
o removed status codes HAM_SHORT_READ and HAM_SHORT_WRITE; instead, 
    HAM_IO_ERROR is now used
o ham_flush() now also flushes the header page (so far the header page was
    forgotten under certain circumstances)
o set the DB_CHUNKSIZE (which is the minimum size of a freelist entry) to 
    32 instead of 64; generated database files are much smaller now

Jul 22, 2007 - chris
o when opening an environment file with ham_open (as a database), the first
    database in the environment is now opened

Jul 21, 2007 - chris
o when opening an environment, the flags were not stored
o don't allow ham_env_create_db if the environment was opened r/o
o calling ham_set_prefix_compare_func and ham_set_compare_func with NULL
    as second parameter resets the compare function to the default
    compare function (based on memcmp)
o bugfix: failed to open environments, which were created with a 
    different pagesize than the default pagesize; fixed

Jul 19, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: if a ham_db_t handle was reused after ham_close, an internal
    pointer was not set to NULL, which resulted in a segfault
o replaced error code HAM_INV_INDEX with HAM_NOT_INITIALIZED
o replaced error code HAM_ENV_FULL with HAM_LIMITS_REACHED

Jun 15, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.4

Jul 13, 2007 - chris
o finalized "environment" functions, APIs and unittests; added a new sample
    (samples/env1.c).

Jul 06, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: freelist pages were not marked as dirty, and therefore 
    sometimes weren't written to disk

Jul 03, 2007 - chris
o bugfix: deleted pages (with db_free_page()) were not moved to the
    freelist, and zombie pages were created

Jun 24, 2007 - chris
o finished the port to Windows CE. Solution files are in the wince 
    directory (configured for STANDARDSDK 5.0 (x86)). See wince/README.TXT
    for the details.

Jun 20, 2007 - chris
o improved the caching of extended keys; the cache is now purged when it's
    too full

Jun 17, 2007 - chris
o added the flag HAM_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE; will lock the file exclusively, as 
    long as it's open. Returns HAM_WOULD_BLOCK if you try to place an
    exclusive lock on a database which was already opened exclusively.

Jun 15, 2007 - chris
o fixed a bug which disabled HAM_DISABLE_MMAP; even if the flag was 
    specified, mmap routines were used

Jun 12, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.3

Jun 11, 2007 - chris
o unittests work now on big-endian machines

Jun 10, 2007 - chris
o fixed a small memory leak (in-memory db only, when using extended keys

Jun 04, 2007 - chris
o fixed configure.in - do not build unittests if cppunit is not
    installed

May 30, 2007 - chris
o added unittests for util.c

May 5, 2007 - chris
o new unittests for the freelist

Apr 04, 2007 - chris
o refactored the cache and some other modules
o bugfix in ham_open_ex: the cachesize parameter was ignored; ham_open_ex
    always used HAM_DEFAULT_CACHESIZE

Apr 02, 2007 - chris

Mar 27, 2007 - chris
o database files are now endian-agnostic; hamsterdb can now use big-endian 
    databases on little-endian architectures and vice versa 

Mar 21, 2007 - chris
o removed HAM_OPEN_EXCLUSIVELY - i'll replace it with file locking in a 
    few weeks
o use mmap if the db-pagesize is a multiple of the os-pagesize, and not 
    just if it's equal
o do not store the following flags in the database: HAM_DISABLE_VAR_KEYLEN,
    HAM_CACHE_STRICT, HAM_DISABLE_MMAP, HAM_OPEN_EXCLUSIVELY, 
    HAM_WRITE_THROUGH, HAM_READ_ONLY, HAM_OPTIMIZE_SIZE, 
    HAM_DISABLE_FREELIST_FLUSH
o fixed an unlikely crash in ham_cursor_move: if the cursor was nil after 
    moving the cursor, return an error

Mar 17, 2007 - chris
o added configure-option --enable-internal to enable all internal 
    functions (ham_dump and ham_check_integrity). disabling those functions
    shrinks the library size by a few kilobytes
o improved the documentation in the header-files

Mar 16, 2007 - chris
o improved configure.in - added --enable-shrink, removed optimizations 
    for --enable-debug, all other modes will now use -O3

Mar 06, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.1

Mar 04, 2007
o moved the ./tests-subdirectory to a separate repository

Mar 03, 2007
o win32 compiles and links as a static or dynamic library with Visual C++ 
    2005 Express Edition; testes are all successful

Feb 11, 2007
o many small changes to compile everything on cygwin

Feb 04, 2007 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.4.0

Feb 03, 2007 - chris
o all write-functions return an error if they're called but the 
    database is in read-only mode
o added a new sample db3.c, which reads words from stdin and prints them 
    in sorted order
o removed the flag HAM_OPEN_CREATE; it was broken anyway

Feb 02, 2007 - chris
o database cursors are now fully implemented and tested

Jan 24, 2007 - chris
o default behaviour for ham_create changed; already existing files are now
    overwritten
o now uses -Wall on platforms with gcc
o resized the default cache size from 128kb to 256kb

Jan 23, 2007 - chris
o added a new sample db2.c, which copies an existing database to another
    database using a cursor.

Jan 21, 2007 - chris
o the cursor implementation is finished and seems to work; testing is not 
    yet complete. 
o ham_flush now has an (unused) flags-parameter.
o renamed samples/simple.c to samples/db1.c

Jan 20, 2007 - chris
o created one global transaction-pointer in the database object, and 
    removed all transaction parameters for most functions; added tests that 
    only one single transaction object is created.

Dec 23, 2006 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.3.1

Dec 23, 2006 - chris
o header-files are now installed to $prefix/include/ham
o test is not build if db.h is missing

Dec 19, 2006 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.3

Dec 15, 2006 - chris
o started the port to MS Windows; so far, there are only two batch
    files to create the library, but no nmake file or Visual Studio 
    project.
o started to move the stuff to automake/autoconf; transition is not
    yet complete

Dec 10, 2006 - chris 
o a new parameter HAM_OPTIMIZE_SIZE creates smaller files by merging 
    freelist entries (comes at a small performance penalty)

Nov 26, 2006 - chris 
o extended keys are now cached (if the cache size is big enough) 

Nov 24, 2006 - chris 
o added HAM_DISABLE_FREELIST_FLUSH - when a freelist page is modified, it 
    is no longer flushed immediately. this is dangerous - in case of a 
    crash, the database is most likely broken.

Nov 23, 2006 - chris 
o fixed a small leak - if records are overwritten, and the new record size
    is smaller then sizeof(ham_offset_t), the old blob was not added to 
    the freelist

Nov 22, 2006 - chris 
o completely rewrote the freelist - elements are now sorted, and access is 
    a lot faster. also, elements are merged, if possible, which 
    results in smaller files
o fixed a bug; if the root page is split, the address of the root page
    was not stored correctly in the database header

Nov 12, 2006 - chris 
o completely rewrote the blob storage - blobs are now stored in one big 
    chunk, and not splitted into pages
o replaced read/write with pread/pwrite
o fixed a small bug related to a performance improvement on Nov 5th
    (removed too many memset's...)

Nov 09, 2006 - chris 
o fetching in-memory-blobs created a memory leak if the record data 
    was allocated by the user

Nov 07, 2006 - chris 
o blobs which were overwritten (and therefore were deleted) were not 
    added to the freelist

Nov 05, 2006 - chris 
o fixed a tiny memory leak in blob_erase
o replaced linear search in btree_get_slot and btree_insert with 
    binary search, got significant performance improvements
o removed some unnecessary memsets, after allocating a new page
o relaxed the "minkey"-rule: after erasing, pages are now merged when 
    there are <=4 elements in the page

Nov 04, 2006 - chris ---------------------------------------------------
                      release of hamsterdb-0.1pre2

Oct 26, 2006 - chris
o fixed a bug in the freelist - the return value was ignored, when 
    allocating a new page. if the cache was too small, NULL was returned
    and the library crashed

Oct 24, 2006 - chris
o fixed minor issues for compiling on 32bit machines

Oct 18, 2006 - chris
o fixed a bug in the freelist - too many freelist pages were allocated
o fixed a bug: when allocating pages, and the page was removed from the
    freelist, and the page type was not set correctly

Oct 12, 2006 - chris
o fixed a bug in blob_allocate when allocating big blobs
o fixed a bug when overwriting keys, and the blob was empty, tiny or 
    small (<=sizeof(ham_offset_t))

Oct 8, 2006 - chris
o completely rewrote the test environment (./dbtest.py)

Oct 3, 2006 - chris
o rewrote the SConscript and all scons-files
o added the Doxyfile (Doxygen build script) to generate the documentation

Sep 22, 2006 - chris
o added the README-file
o enabled support for O_LARGEFILE

Sep 21, 2006 - chris
o renamed COPYING to LICENSE; also renamed the header comments in all files
