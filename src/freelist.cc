/**
* Search for a sufficiently large free slot in the freelist bit-array.
*
* Before v1.0.9, this was a sequential scan, sped up by first scanning
* QWORDs in an outer loop in order to find spots with at least 1 free
* bit, then an inner loop which would perform a bit-level scan only a
* free bit was located by the outer loop.
*
* The 'aligned' search acted a little different: it had an outer loop
* which scanned BYTEs at a time, instead of QWORDs, while the inner
* bit-level scan loop would only last until the requested number of
* bits had been scanned, when failing to hit a valid free slot, thus
* returning to the outer, faster loop (a behaviour which was NOT
* exhibited by the 'regular' search method: once inside the inner
* bit-level loop, it would _stay_ there. The 'aligned' scan would also
* stop scanning when the end-requested_size bit was tested, while the
* 'regular' loop continued on until the very end of the bitarray.
*
* This was very slow, especially in scenarios where tiny free slots
* are located near the front of the bitarray (which represents the
* storage layout of the whole database, incidentally).
*
*  A few improvements can be thought of (and have been implemented):
*
* - first off, do as the 'aligned' search already did, but now for
*   everyone: stop scanning at the END-requested_size bit: any
*   free space _starting_ beyond that point is too small anyway.
*
* - 'aligned' search is searching for space aligned at a DB page
*   edge (256 bytes or bigger) and since we 'know' the requested size
*   is also large (and very, very probably a multiple of
*   64*DB_CHUNKSIZE (== 2K) as the only one requesting
*   page-aligned storage is requesting an entire page (>=2K!) of
*   storage anyway), we can get away here by NOT scanning at
*   bit level, but at QWORD level only.
*
*   EDIT v1.1.1: This has been augmented by a BYTE-level search as
*                odd-Kb pagesizes do exist (e.g. 1K pages) and these
*                are NOT aligned to the QWORD boundary of
*                <code>64 * DB_CHUNKSIZE</code> = 2Kbytes (this is the
*                amount of storage space covered by a single QWORD
*                worth of freelist bits).  See also the @ref DB_PAGESIZE_MIN_REQD_ALIGNMENT define.
*
* - Boyer-Moore scanning instead of sequential: since a search
*   for free space is basically a search for a series of
*   SIZE '1' bits, we can employ characteristics as used by the
*   Boyer-Moore string search algorithm (and it's later
*   improvements, such as described by [Hume & Sunday]). While we
*   'suffer' from the fact that we are looking for 'string
*   matches' in an array which has a character alphabet of size 2:
*   {0, 1}, as we are considering BITS here, we can still employ
*   the ideas of Boyer-Moore et al to speed up our search
*   significantly. Here are several elements to consider:
*
*   # we can not easily (or not at all) implement the
*     suggested improvement where there's a sentinel at the
*     end of the searched range, as we are accessing mapped
*     memory, which will cause an 'illegal access' exception
*     to fire when we sample bytes/words outside the alloted
*     range. Of course, this issue could be resolved by
*     'tweaking' the freelist pages upon creation by ensuring
*     there's a 'sentinel range' available at the end of each
*     freelist page. THAT will be something to consider for
*     the 'modern' Data Access Mode freelist algorithm(s)...
*
*   # since we have an alphabet of size 2, we don't have to
*     bother with 'least frequent' and 'most frequent'
*     characters in our pattern: we will _always_ be looking
*     for a series of 1 bits. However, we can improve the scan,
*     as was done in the classic search algorithm, by inspecting
*     QWORDs at a time instead of bits. Still, we can think of
*     the alphabet as being size = 2, as there's just two
*     character values of interest: 0 and 'anything else', which
*     is our '1' in there. Expressing the length of the searched
*     pattern in QWORDs will also help find probable slots
*     as we can stick to the QWORD-dimensioned scanning as
*     long as possible, only resolving to bit-level scans at
*     the 'edges' of the pattern.
*
*   # the classic BM (Boyer-Moore) search inspected the character
*     at the end of the pattern and then backtracked; we can
*     improve our backtracking by assuming a few things about
*     both the pattern and the search space: since our pattern
*     is all-1s and we can can assume that our search space,
*     delimited by a previous sample which was false, and the
*     latest sample, distanced pattern_length bits apart, is
*     mostly 'used bits' (zeroes), we MAY assume that the
*     free space in there is available more towards the end
*     of this piece of the range. In other words: the searched
*     space can be assumed to be SORTED over the current
*     pattern_length bitrange -- which means we can employ
*     a binary search mechanism to find the 'lowest' 1-bit
*     in there. We add an average cost there of the binary
*     search at O(log(P)) (where P = pattern_size) as we
*     will have to validate the result returned by such a
*     binary search by scanning forward sequentially, but
*     on average, we will save cycles as we do the same
*     bsearch on the NEXT chunk of size P, where we assume
*     the data is sorted in REVERSE order and look for the
*     first '0' instead: these two bsearches will quickly
*     deliver a sufficiently trustworthy 'probable size of
*     free area' to do this before we wind down to a (costly)
*     sequential scan. Note that the two bsearches can
*     be reduced to the first only, if its verdict is that
*     the range starts at offset -P+1, i.e. the first bit
*     past the previous (failed) sample in the skip loop.
*     The two blocks bsearched are, given the above, assumed
*     to show a series of '1' bits within an outer zone
*     of '0' bits on both sides; that's why the second
*     bsearch should assume REVERSE sorted order, as we wish
*     to find the first '0' AFTER the last '1' in there,
*     so that we have an indicator of the end-of-1-range
*     position in the search space.
*
*   # as we look for an all-1 pattern, our skip loop can
*     skip P-1 bits at a time, as a bit sampled being '0'
*     means the P'th bit after that one must be '1' to
*     get us a match. When we get such a hit, we do not
*     know if it's the start or end of the match yet,
*     so that's why we scan backwards and forwards using
*     the bsearches suggested above. (Especially for large
*     pattern sizes is the bsearch-before-sequential 'prescan'
*     considered beneficial.)
*
*   # As we scan the freelist, we can gather statictics:
*     how far we had to scan into the entire range before
*     we hit our _real_ free slot:
*     by remembering this position, the next search for
*     a similar sized pattern can be sped up by starting
*     at the position (adjusted: + old P size, of course)
*     we found our last match.
*
*     When we delete a record, we can adjust this position
*     to the newly created free space, when the deleted
*     entry creates a suitably large free area.
*
*     This implies that we might want to keep track of
*     a 'search start position' for a set of sizes instead
*     of just one: even on a fixed-width DB, there's the
*     key and the record data. The initial idea here is
*     to track it for log8(P) ranges, i.e. one tracker
*     for sizes up to 2^8, one more for sizes up 2^16,
*     nd so on (maybe later upgrade this to log2(P) ranges).
*
*   # As we scan the freelist, we can gather statictics:
*     the number of times we had a 'probable hit' (which
*     failed to deliver):
*     As the ratio of the number of 'false hits' versus
*     actual searches increases, we can speed up our
*     searches by looking for a larger free slot (maybe
*     even using the first-pos tracker for the next larger
*     sizes set as mentioned in the previous point):
*     by doing so we can, hopefully, start at a higher
*     position within the range. At the cost of creating
*     'gaps' in the storage which will remain unused for
*     a long time (in our current model, these statistics
*     are gathered per run, so the next open/access/close
*     run of the DB will reset these statistics).
*
* Further notes:
*
* as we keep the statistics in cache
* rather permanently (as long as the cache itself lives),
* any changes applied to the DB freelist by a second,
* asynchronous writer (freeing additional space in
* the freelist there) will go undiscovered, at least as
* far a extra FREEd space is concerned; changes which
* ALLOCATE space will be detected immediately as the
* freelist data is scanned.
* The concequence is a probably larger DB file and more
* freelist fragmentation when multiple writers access
* a single DB -- which I frown upon anyway.
*
*
* The Boyer-Moore skip loop can help us jump through
* the freelist pages faster; this skip loop can be
* employed at both the QWORD and BIT search levels.
*
*   # The bsearch backtracking 'prescans' should maybe
*     be disabled for smaller sizes, e.g. for sizes up
*     to length = 8, as it does not help speed up
*     matters a whole darn lot in that case anyway.
*
*   # An alternative to plain Boyer-Moore skip loop, etc.
*     is to take the bsearch idea a step further: we
*     know the skip loop step size (P), given the
*     pattern we are looking for.
*
*     We may also assume that most free space is located
*     at the end of the range: when we express that
*     free space available anywhere in the freelist
*     'but at the very end' is less valuable, we can
*     assume the freelist is SORTED: by not starting
*     by a sequential skip loop scan, but using a
*     bsearch to find the lowest available '1'
*     probable match, we can further improve upon
*     the concept of 'starting at the last known offset'
*     as suggested above. This means we can start
*     the search by a binary search of the range
*     [last_offset .. end_of_freelist] to find the
*     first probable sample match, after which we
*     can go forward using your regular Boyer-Moore
*     skip loop.
*
*     This will [probably] lose free '1' slots which
*     sit within larger '0' areas, but that's what
*     this is about. When our DB access behaviour is
*     generally a lot of insert() and little or
*     no delete(), we can use this approach to get
*     us some free space faster.
*
*   # The above can be enhanced even further by
*     letting HamsterDB gather our access statistics
*     (~ count the number of inserts and deletes
*     during a run) to arrive at an automated choice
*     for this mechanism over others available;
*     instead of the user having to specify a
*     preferred/assumed Data Access Mode, we can
*     deduce the actual one ourselves.
*
*     The drawback of this bsearch-based free slot
*     searching is that we will not re-use free
*     slots within the currently oocupied space,
*     i.e. more freelist fragmentation and a larger
*     DB file as a aresult.
*
*   # Note however that the 'start off with a
*     range bsearch' is internally different from
*     the one/two bsearches in the space backtrack
*     'prescan':
*
*     the latter divide up inspected
*     space to slices of 1 bit each, unless we
*     limit the bsearch prescan to BYTE-level,
*     i.e. 8-bit slices only for speed sake.
*     AH! ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT THERE!
*
*     the former (bsearch-at-start) will ALWAYS
*     limit its divide-and-conquer to slices of
*     P bits (or more); further reducing the
*     minimum slice is identical to having a BM
*     skip loop with a jump distance of P/2 (or
*     lower), which is considered sub-optimal.
*     Such a bsearch would be blending the search
*     pattern into the task area alotted the
*     dual-bsearch backtrack prescans.
*
*     Another notable difference is that the
*     backtracking/forward-tracking inner bsearch
*     prescans can act differently on the
*     discovery of an apparently UNORDERED
*     search space: those bsearches may hit '0's
*     within a zone of '1's, i.e. hit the '0' marked
*     '^' in this search space - which was assumed
*     to be ORDERED but clearly is NOT:
*
*       0000 1111 1111 0^111
*
*     and such an occurrence (previous lower
*     sample=='1', while current sample==='0')
*     can cause those bsearches to stop scanning
*     this division and immediate adjust the range
*     to current_pos+1..end_of_range and continue
*     to sample the median of that new range.
*     This would be absolutely valid bahaviour.
*
*     (Reverse '0' and '1' and range determination
*      for the second, forward-tracking bsearch
*      there, BTW.)
*
*     However, the starting, i.e. 'outer' bsearch
*     may not decide to act that way: after all,
*     the range may have gaps, one of which
*     has just been discovered, so here the bsearch
*     should really assume the newly found in-zone
*     '1' free marker to be at the END of the
*     inspected range and look for more '1's down
*     from here: after all, this bsearch is looking
*     for the first PROBABLE free slot and as such
*     is a close relative of the BM skip loop.
*
*   # as our pattern is all-1s anyway, there is
*     problem in adjusted the BM search so as
*     to assume we're skiploop-scanning for the
*     FIRST character in the pattern; after all,
*     it's identical to the LAST one: '1'.
*
*     This implies that we have simpler code while
*     dealing with aligned searches as well as
*     regular. And no matter if our skip-search was
*     meant to look for the last (or first)
*     character: any hit would mean we've hit a
*     spot somewhere 'in the middle' of the search
*     pattern; given the all-1s, we then need to
*     find out through backtracking (and forward~)
*     where in the pattern we did land: at the
*     start, end or really in the middle.
*
*     Meanwhile, aligned matches are kept simple
*     this way, as they now can assume that they
*     always landed at the START of the pattern.
*
* --------
*
* FURTHER THOUGHTS:
*
*   # given our initial implementation and analysis,
*     we can assume that the 'header page' is always
*     reserved in the freelist for any valid database.
*
*     This is a major important bit of info, as it
*     essentially serves as both a sentinel, which
*     has a pagesize, i.e. is a sentinel as large
*     as the largest freelist request (as those
*     come in one page or smaller at a time).
*
*     This gives us the chance to implement other
*     Boyer-Moore optimizations: we don't need
*     to check the lower bound any longer AND
*     we can always start each scan at START+PAGE
*     offset at least, thus skipping those headerpage
*     '0' bits each time during the regular phase of
*     each search.
*
*     [Edit] Unfortunately, this fact only applies
*     to the initial freelist page, so we cannot use
*     it as suggested above :-(
*
*   # aligned scans are START-probe based, while
*     unaligned scans use the classic Boyer-Moore
*     END-probe; this is faster overall, as the subsequent
*     REV linear scan will then produce the length
*     of the leading range, which is (a) often
*     enough to resolve the request, and (b) is
*     hugging previous allocations when we're
*     scanning at the end of the search space,
*     which is an desirable artifact.
*
*     This does not remove the need for some
*     optional FWD linear scans to determine the
*     suitability of the local range, but these
*     will happen less often.

             * scanner basic inspection chunk: when we have thus
             * ascertained a hit, all we need to do is determine _which_
             * bit caused the non-zero-ness of such a multi-byte integer
             * value.
             *
             * Having said that, there's another interesting bit here:
             * since START==END, the prescan is pretty useless... or
             * put in equivalent terms: the prescan IS the ENTIRE scan:
             * since we will hit that sought-after '1'-bit in the
             * prescan for certain, the entire main scan loop can be
             * discarded.
             *
             * And last but not least: we can still apply the prescan
             * optimizations as we do them otherwise; any scheme which
             * is not skipping bytes (and thereby introducing
             * sparseness) is identical to a straight-forward linear
             * scan, due to the pattern width == 1. That means we don't
             * need to perform any fancy footwork here, unless we think
             * we have something that's orders of magnitude better than
             * a linear scan and still promises some reasonable
             * results -- all I can think of here is the binary search
             * 'fast prescan' alternative here, as BM (Boyer-Moore)
             * just lost it, all the way.
             *
             * Anyway, the biggest speed gain we can get is due to the
             * statistics gatherer, which can hint us where to start
             * looking the next time around.
             *
             * The statistics gatherer/hinter does not help with
             * pathological cases such as (create a large filled space, then
             * apply pattern
             * 'write 2 keys, delete 1 key' repetivily, so that each
             * two inserts lands one in the 1-bit gap produced at the
             * start of the file due to the delete/erase operation,
