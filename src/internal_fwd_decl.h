/**
 * @brief provides forward declarations of internally used types
 *
 * This header file provides these forward declarations to prevent several
 * cyclic dependencies; in particular, the @ref Page is a type used
 * throughout, but a @ref Page contains several other types, which
 * again reference @ref Page pointers either directly or indirectly.
 *
 * To solve this self-referential issue once and for all, all major hamster
 * internal types are forward declared here; when the code requires the actual
 * implementation of a type it can include the related header file any time it
 * wishes.
 *
 * @remark This way of solving the cyclic dependency conundrum has the added
 *     benefit of having a single, well known spot where the actual
 *     'typedef' lines reside, so there's zero risk of 'double defined types'.
