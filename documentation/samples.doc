<h3>Samples for C/C++</h3>

The samples are part of the hamsterdb Embedded Storage sources; you can 
find them in the directory <i>samples</i>. For your convenience, they are 
available for downloading.

<a href="db1_8c-example.html">db1.c</a>
Simple example of creating a Database, inserting some items, search for these
items and erase them 

<a href="db2_8c-example.html">db2.c</a>
Uses a Cursor to copy one Database to another; this can also be used to copy an
In-Memory Database into a file Database and vice versa

<a href="db3_8c-example.html">db3.c</a>
Demonstrates how to use hamsterdb Embedded Storage for sorting large amounts of data

<a href="db4_8c-example.html">db4.c</a>
Demonstrates the use of Record Number Databases; reads a text file from stdin
and creates a Database entry for every word. Then prints all words in the
original order.

<a href="db5_8c-example.html">db5.c</a>
Demonstrates the use of duplicate items; reads a text file from stdin and
creates a Database entry for every word, even if the word is a duplicate. Then
prints all words in alphabetical order and prints the line number of each
occurrence.

<a href="db6_8cpp-example.html">db6.cpp</a>
Same as db1.c, but written in C++

<a href="env1_8c-example.html">env1.c</a>
Shows how to use Environments; creates two Databases to manage Customers and
Orders

<a href="env2_8c-example.html">env2.c</a>
Shows how to use Environments; creates two Databases to manage Customers and
Orders, and a third Database with duplicate keys for the 1:n relation.

<a href="env3_8cpp-example.html">env3.cpp</a>
Same as env2.c, but written in C++

items and erase them.

items and erase them
