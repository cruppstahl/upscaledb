NOTE: I wanted all pages to appear on the 'Related Pages' tab, and then it turns out that \subpage does not do that, while \ref does. Maybe I FUBARed, I don't know. This is a quick hack to show a case in point anyway.

<h2>What is hamsterdb Embedded Storage?</h2>

hamsterdb Embedded Storage is a lightweight embedded database engine. It 
concentrates on ease of use, high performance, stability and portability.

Please visit the <a href="http://hamsterdb.com/about">About</a> page for 
more information.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

This manual is divided into three parts, each of which is divided into 
several sections.

The first part offers general information about hamsterdb:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.hamsterdb.com/about/features">features</a> page lists all major features of hamsterdb.
<li>The <a href="http://www.hamsterdb.com/download">download</a> page for downloading hamsterdb sources or precompiled libraries.
<li>The <a href="http://www.hamsterdb.com/about/platforms">supported platforms</a> page lists platforms for which hamsterdb was ported.
<li>The <a href="http://www.hamsterdb.com/licensing">licensing</a> page explains open source and commercial licensing options.
<li>The \ref history section shows what has changed during the development of hamsterdb and what is in store for future releases.
</ul>

The second part forms a reference manual:

<ul>
<li>The <a href="modules.html">Modules</a> page is the entry point for the hamsterdb C/C++ API reference.
<li>Section \ref samples shows the hamsterdb Samples for C/C++, Python, .NET, Java and other supported languages.
<li>Section \ref starting tells you how to generate your first hamsterdb application quickly. 
<li>Section \ref tuning explains how you can customize your hamsterdb usage and invocation to get an even faster run-time performance from hamsterdb.
<li>Section \ref faq "FAQ" gives answers to frequently asked questions. 
<li>Section \ref trouble "Troubleshooting" tells you what to do when you have problems.
</ul>

The third part provides internal architectural and library implementation information 
for those developers who have a technology itch they need to scratch. This part is targeted
at those people who have special needs and need (or want) to extend the hamsterdb library
itself.

<ul>
<li>Section \ref arch gives a global overview of how hamsterdb is internally
    structured.
<li>Section \ref got_geek is a collection of implementation details for those who really
                 feel the need for knowledge of the nitty gritty of hamsterdb internals.
</ul>

\remark When you just wish to \e use hamsterdb, reading this third part of the manual 
would very probably be overkill.

Additional information is listed here:

<li>\ref appendix_gpl3
<li>\ref appendix_gnu_free_doc_license
</ul>

\example db1.c Simple example of creating a Database, inserting some items, search for these items and erase them 
\example db2.c Uses a Cursor to copy one Database to another; this can also be used to copy an In-Memory Database into a file Database and vice versa
\example db3.c Demonstrates how to use hamsterdb Embedded Storage for sorting large amounts of data
\example db4.c Demonstrates the use of Record Number Databases; reads a text file from stdin and creates a Database entry for every word. Then prints all words in the original order.
\example db5.c Demonstrates the use of duplicate items; reads a text file from stdin and creates a Database entry for every word, even if the word is a duplicate. Then prints all words in alphabetical order and prints the line number of each occurrence.
\example db6.cpp Same as db1.c, but written in C++
\example env1.c Shows how to use Environments; creates two Databases to manage Customers and Orders
\example env2.c Shows how to use Environments; creates two Databases to manage Customers and Orders, and a third Database with duplicate keys for the 1:n relation.
\example env3.cpp Same as env2.c, but written in C++
