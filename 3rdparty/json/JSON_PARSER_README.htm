A JSON parser based on http://www.json.org's JSON_checker code.

JSON parser features:
- arbitrary levels of JSON object/array nesting,
- C-style comments,
- UTF-16 & escape sequence (\uXXXX) decoding to UTF-8.
- Manual processing of floating point values.

The parser processes UTF-8 encoded JSON only.
JSON object keys and JSON strings are returned as UTF-8 encoded C strings.
