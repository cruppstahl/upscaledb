This branch is in "maintenance mode". New features are on the branch 
"bleeding_edge" (version 2.0.0.rc1 and newer).

x ham_env_flush deletes all pages that are not used - cache is not used
    -> see mail from Mark  

o decrease logging threshold; no need to have it so high
    if it's not too much effort: get rid of the log file switching as well

o add changes from Bhautik (low heap mode, embedded platform)

o add to webpage (doesn't need precompiled win32 files)
    o with comparison table of the two versions
    o Wiki: "Which version should i choose?"
    o add MPIC32 as a (non-supported) platform

o fix big-endian conversion issue, add as unittest (also to 2.0)
