==============================================================================

------------- hamsterdb-erlang 2.1.9 ---------------------------------

x upgrade to hamsterdb-2.1.9

o improve erlang integration
    o integration for quickcheck-ci.com
    x look into Thomas' mail

------------- hamsterdb pro 2.1.9 ------------------------------------

x PRO: review AES usage in read_page; if the page is mmapped then decryption
    is not applied - no, it's ok. encryption disables mmap

o PRO: rebase to vanilla 2.1.9

o PRO: review SIMD code; the problem is that it's never called, because the
    search threshold is always smaller than the minimum block size
    o use fixed block size, otherwise fallback to non-simd search
    o run performance tests

o PRO: refactoring: make AES Encryption stateless and exception safe

o PRO: refactoring: make Compressors stateless and exception safe

o PRO: Can we release an early version of zint32? (undocumented)
    o need to fix erase() handling
    o add full test coverage

o PRO: look for a better compression for DefaultRecordList, i.e.
    o try to move the Zint32 index to a base class
    o Use small index which stores offset + bits for each group
    o Each group is a GroupedVarInt w/ 4 bits per entry; a 64bit
        number can then hold flags for 16 numbers
        o (but maybe increase this to hold at least 32 or 64 numbers, to
            reduce the overhead ratio)
    o a separate bit is used to signal whether the (compressed) number is
        a record id
    o avoid ripple effects by growing/splitting the block
    o Use this index for the default internal record list
    o Use this index for duplicate groups

------------- hamsterdb 2.1.10 ---------------------------------------

o get rid of HAM_API_REVISION, move HAM_VERSION_* to the header file, or
            move version.h to include/ham

o documentation rewrite
    o use github wiki, remove old cruft
    o then create the initial repository:
        https://github.com/blog/699-making-github-more-open-git-backed-wikis

    o have the hamsterdb/documentation directory "link" to the git project

o grow allocated memory buffers exponentially
    https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2014/11/04/please-grow-your-buffers-exponentially/comment-page-1/#comment-23272
    this only affects the ByteArray, as far as i can see

o refactoring: make journal stateless and exception safe

o refactoring: make changeset stateless and exception safe

o refactoring: make BlobManager stateless and exception safe

o refactoring: make PageManager stateless and exception safe

o refactoring: make EnvironmentHeader stateless and exception safe
    -> will it ever be used outside of the EnvironmentConfiguration setting?
    -> can we remove it?

o refactoring: make Btree Actions stateless and exception safe

o refactoring: improve the code separation of cursor and txn_cursor, i.e.
    in db_local::cursor_get_record_size (wtf - is_null(0)?)
    etc
    -> clean up the whole Cursor stuff

o refactoring: clean up the whole Database code; it's too much and too
    complex; there must be an absolutely clear border between Btree and
    Transaction related code.

o reserve file size upon creation, then map the whole range
    o needs new parameter HAM_PARAM_ALLOCATE_FILE_BYTES
    o support in ham_bench
    o monster tests and performance tests
    o also for java
    o also for dotnet
    o also for python
    o also for erlang

o bulk updates/batched updates
    - give users API to allocate memory for keys/records
    - if user says that data is already sorted then do not re-sort, but
        fail hard if the sort order is violated
    - add those delta updates to the txn-trees or to the btree node,
        simply transfer ownership of the memory
    - can contain inserts or deletes
    o the Update structure, which describes a single update, can also
        be used internally to pass all parameters to the Btree actions;
        they would then be completely stateless
    o also for remote, transfer in a single message
    o also for .NET
    o also for java
    o also for erlang
    o also for python

o look into dynomite, spark, mongodb and mariadb integration
    https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite
    -> like MapReduce, Spark requires an InputFormat class; templates are 
        available here:
        https://github.com/hypertable/hypertable/blob/master/src/java/MapReduce/org/hypertable/hadoop/mapreduce/InputFormat.java
        https://github.com/hypertable/hypertable/blob/master/src/java/MapReduce/org/hypertable/hadoop/mapred/TextTableInputFormat.java (streaming)

    -> would be an interesting market with requirements for column store
        storage
    -> how does the integration look like?
    -> has TPC-benchmarks and other benchmarks ready
    o write down everything i find, collect information and estimate
        efforts/gains (will do the same for mysql, R and mongodb later); this
        task is not about writing code!
    o come up with priorities, estimates

    o dynomite: requires C interface and C marshalling code. rewrite C++
        marshalling routines to C
    o dynomite: send a patch to support more backends
    o dynomite: send a patch to separate existing backends into their own file

o First steps towards concurrency; target is having one lock per db
    o create coding rules which help for thread-safety
        o make members const whenever possible
        o non-const members need to lock or be atomic
        o if a class is deliberately NOT threadsafe (i.e. ByteArray) then
            document as annotation, and create a special profile build
            which verifies that all non-const members are accessed synchronized

        class SingleThreadedGuard {
          SingleThreadedGuard() {
            if (atomic_inc(foo) != 1) 
              throw ...;
          }

          ~SingleThreadedGuard() {
            if (atomic_dec(foo) > 0)
              throw ...;
          }
        };
    o can we also utilize valgrind macros?
    o need to compile this with -O3, release builds!
    o perform this for layers 1 - 3
    o and also for layer 4 - make sure that the code separation is clear
        -> especially between btree and transactions
    o define the locking behaviour of all classes/logical modules
    o verify this behaviour in the code 
    o define which public API function locks what
    o split the big lock and create one lock per database
    o perform excessive testing

o Next steps towards concurrency: flush caches asynchronously,
    use non-blocking writes (with libuv)
    o or have a separate thread perform purges, flushes with libuv
    o ... and prefetches (when opening a database with HAM_PREFETCH_INDEX)

o Next steps towards concurrency; target is having one writer per db, but
        multiple readers
    o move flushing of transactions into background
    o move cache purging into background
    o background operations should be disabled with flags
    o perform excessive testing










. refactoring: get rid of inheritance for env
    - move implementation to a struct, w/o state
    - struct will be kept separately (if there is any)
    - base class will be abstract
    - the env will become a "hub" which manages members (i.e. page_manager,
        device) and forwards the calls to those members 
    - implementation class uses a template parameter and forwards calls
        to the struct; the state is a parameter which is only updated
        if the operation succeeds
    - if this pattern works then also apply it for Database,
        Transaction, Cursor

o PRO: find an efficient compression method for InternalRecordList
    -> also, this should play well with the compression of the DefaultRecordList
    x The page IDs should be modulo page-size (makes numbers smaller) - done

o PRO: use compression also for duplicate records

o PRO: prefix compression for variable-length keys
    use an indirection for the prefixes and suffixes; store each
    part in a slot. the keys themselves have then fixed length (2 slot id's)
        ==> supports efficient binary search!
        ==> is efficient for random read/writes AND linear scans
        however, it's very complex to figure out how to optimally split the
        strings into prefixes and suffixes
    ==> prefixes and suffixes can be stored as extended keys if they become
        too large
    see indexcompression2009.pdf - Efficient index compression in DB2 LUW
    o look for more research papers

. release-v2.pl: valgrind takes sooo long. should we use clang's
    AddressSanitizer instead? or both?

. hola - next steps
    o support java api
    o support .net api
    o support erlang api
    o lua-functions as callbacks - then remote marshalling will work
    o PRO: compile callbacks with clang remotely
    o add remote support where it makes sense (only for PRO?)

. architecture for a new webpage
    o pick an awesome design
        i.e. similar to http://foundationdb.com, http://laravel.com,
        http://rethinkdb.com, http://www.orientechnologies.com
    o use make/m4/markdown to generate static pages:
        https://github.com/datagrok/m4-bakery
        https://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/
    o come up with the full site structure/contents
        http://sidekiq.org/pro/
        o include full documentation, one page per API
        o ... and for all languages
        o keep the documentation in the source tree, not in -www?
    o documentation comments are hosted on disqus
    o blog comments are hosted on disqus, articles are also written in markup

    o static pages will be served with nginx, using url rewrites
    o dynamic pages are created with a micro-framework (silex?)
    o Makefile can "scp -r" everything to the servers (staging or production)

    . client area with (low priority)
        o authentication
        o collection of files
        o analytics (who downloads what and when?)
    . admin area with (even lower priority)
        o authentication
        o customer database
        o implementing business processes
        o sending out release emails
        o importing new releases
        o etc

. hola: use sum-prefix-trees to precalculate partial sums/results?
    they could be stored in a btree, and used to dynamically recalculate
    requested values 
    https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/papers/Ble93.pdf

o QuickCheck: automatically test the recovery feature by invoking "crashes"

o QuickCheck: create a new property for testing duplicates; the key is
    always the same. The number of duplicate keys is tracked and
    periodically checked with the API. A cursor can be used to remove a
    specific duplicate, or to fetch a specific duplicate.

. use cache-oblivious b-tree layout
    -> http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/cacheObliviousBTree.html
    o see roadmap document for more information
    o this feature is *per database*
    o calculate number of reqd pages based on estimated keys from the user
        (but what about the blobs??)
    o make sure that this is not reverted when "reduce file size" feature
        (above) is enabled
    o the new pages are not managed by the freelist! therefore the freelist
        will not need any modifications
    o after resize: mmap the whole file area. this is actually important because
        mmap is much faster than r/w; but when the database is created, the
        original mapping already exists. therefore we might have to handle
        more than one mapping in the file
    o PageManager: when allocating a new page then use the distribution
        function to fetch a page from the reserved storage
    . try to batch allocations; when new pages are required then don't just
        allocate one but multiple pages (if the database is big enough)
        -> could create a second memory mapping for the next chunk

o delta updates managed in the BtreeNode
    the operations are attached to the node, but as soon as the node
    is accessed for a lookup or a scan, or immediately before the node
    is flushed, the deltas are merged into the node. So far this does not
    sound too efficient, but the bulk updates in combination with the
    key compression (i.e. for prefix compression) will benefit a lot.

    Also, they are really required for concurrency and to allow multiple
    writers in parallel.

    x perform a benchmark/profiling: random inserts vs. ascending inserts;
        the difference should be caused by memcopy/memmove (is it?)
        x PAX
            -> absolutely worth the effort, about 60% are spent in memmove
        x Default
            -> also worth the effort, about 15% are spent in memmove

    o need a flag to disable DeltaUpdates
        o add flag to ham_bench
    o rename TransactionOperation to DeltaUpdate, decouple code from txn
    o totally transparent to the caller, handled in the proxy
    o only add deltas to leaf nodes; internal nodes have too many read
        operations and would anyway require immediate flushes
    o DeltaUpdate objects from a txn-flush should directly go down to
        the node (detach from txn, attach to node)
    o should the the insert + set_record operations be combined into a
        single call? this has the additional advantage that the overhead
        of calling set_record will disappear
    o merge delta updates when reading and flushing
        o however, for simple lookup calls (no duplicates) the DUs can
            be traversed, too 
    o requires_split() must take delta updates into account
    o make the merge algorithm as efficient as possible
        o sort deltas by key
        o first execute all 'erase' either against other deltas or against
            the node
        o then merge the remaining inserts
        o this needs lots of tests
    o now run tests: should every update be stored as a DeltaUpdate? If not
        then disable them by default, unless Transactions are used (and unless
        bulk updates are used)


o the bucket for concurrency TODOs
    this are the requirements:
    - PRO: inserts are fully concurrent (APL: only one insert at a time)
    - transactions are flushed in background
    - dirty pages are flushed in background
    - reading pages is synchronous, writing pages is asynchronous
        -> needs a very fast locking scheme
    - SSDs support many async. writes in parallel - be prepared!
    http://meetingcpp.com/tl_files/2013/talks/scaling_with_cpp11_edouard_alligand.pdf
    - remove db_get_last_error?
    - how to deal with temporary pointers (key->data, record->data)?
        store them in tls? or always allocate new pointers and let the caller
        delete them?

    o an intermediate stage would be to have concurrent reads but exclusive
        writes (one writer per database, many readers) - makes sense?

    o create coding rules
        o synchronization either in lowest or highest level of the callstack
        o when to use what kind of synchronization
        o which modules are single-threaded/synchronized, which are atomic,
            which are concurrent?

    o how can we verify the correctness of the implementation?
        - i.e. by using static analysis or dynamic analysis, together
            with annotated code/custom tools? even if these tools do not
            exist then a system of annotations/naming conventions can help
            writing/maintaining the code

    o mutex implementations should have built-in monitoring, i.e.
        number of locks/unlocks, wait times, contention etc
        o need read/write mutex, fast latches

    o come up with a list of all functions, define which locking operation
        is required; then review the code and make sure this will work
        o the environment configuration
        o the database configuration
        o the transaction tree handling
        o the page manager, the device and the cache
        o the btree
        o the btree nodes (i.e. extkeycache, compressor)
        o parallel lookups (using the same memory arena)

    o reduce the linked lists - they're hard to be updated with atomic
        operations
        o page
        o transaction and dependent objects
        o ...

    o separate SMOs from the actual operation (#2)
        -> check the literature
        http://pdf.aminer.org/000/409/763/b_trees_with_relaxed_balance.pdf
        o move SMO operations to "the janitor" (btree_janitor.h)

    o the global environment-lock should go because it's expensive; rather
        increment an atomic latch, and refuse to close/erase the database as
        long as the latch is > 0 




o PRO: hot backups (vacuumizes to a different file)
    really only for PRO?
    http://sqlite.org/c3ref/backup_finish.html
    - make sure that all transactions are closed
    - perform ham_env_flush
    - then copy the file
    - if compaction is enabled: copies keys w/ iterator
        (later: performs bulk updates)
    --> think this through; how to deal with delta updates? -> merge them
        what if only a few databases should be backed up?
        what if i want to back up in a logical format (i.e. csv)?

o "hola" - olap functions that operate directly on the btree data
    -> see wiki
    -> see java8 stream API:
        http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html
    -> see supersonic:
        https://code.google.com/p/supersonic/
    -> see fast bitmap indices
        http://code.google.com/p/lemurbitmapindex/
    o create a design
    o operations on compressed data (COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), ...)?
    o use async operations or futures/promises
    o deprecate ham_db_get_key_count() (tutorial, documentation)

- bloom filter -> PRO
- concurrency -> PRO

. clean up approx. matching
    o ONLY for cursors
    o Flags: HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH | HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH | HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH (default)
    o lookup: the cursor is coupled to the key, even if the lookup fails
        then perform a lookup:
            found_key == requested_key:
                HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH: ok
                HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH: return move_prev()
                HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH: return move_next()
            found_key < requested_key:
                HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH: ok
                HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH: return move_next()
                HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH: key not found
            found_key > requested_key:
                HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH: ok
                HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH: return move_prev()
                HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH: key not found
    o must work with transactions
    o do not store key flags; the caller has to compare the key
    o remove ham_key_set_intflags, ham_key_get_intflags, key->_flags (?)

. win32: need a release-v2.pl which fully automates the various release steps
    o delete all generated protobuf files
    o build for msvc 2008
    o run unittests for debug and release
    o run samples
    o delete all generated protobuf files
    o build for msvc 2010
    o run unittests for debug and release
    o run samples
    o build release package

. also remove locking from C# and Java APIs

------------------- idea soup ---------------------------------------------

. PRO: should we have a separate "recsize == 0" RecordList for duplicates?
    they could only store the duplicate count (but should be able to deal
    with duplicates that are > 256!)
    -> requires grouped varints

o asynchronous prefetching of pages
    -> see posix_fadvice, libprefetch

o when recovering, give users the choice if active transactions should be
    aborted (default behavior) or re-created
    o needs a function to enumerate them

o A new transactional mode: read-only transactions can run "in the past" - only
    on committed transactions. therefore they avoid conflicts and will always
    succeed.

o need a function to get the txn of a conflict (same as in v2)
    ham_status_t ham_txn_get_conflicting_txn(ham_txn_t *txn, ham_txn_t **other);
        oder: txn-id zurückgeben? sonst gibt's ne race condition wenn ein anderer
        thread "other" committed/aborted
    o also add to c++ API
    o add documentation (header file)
    o add documentation (wiki)

. new test case for cursors
    insert (1, a)
    insert (1, b) (duplicate of 1)
    move (last) (-> 1, b)
    insert (1, c)
    move (last) (-> 1, c)? is the dupecache updated correctly?

. there are a couple of areas where a btree cursor is uncoupled, just to
    retrieve the key and to couple the txn-key. that's not efficient
        db.c:__btree_cursor_points_to
        db.c:__compare_cursors
        txn_cursor.c:cursor_sync
        txn_cursor.c:cursor_overwrite
    o move to a separate function
    o try to optimize

. add tests to verify that the cursor is not modified if an operation fails!
    (in cursor.cpp:LongTxnCursorTest are some wrapper functions to move or
    insert the cursor; that's a good starting point)
