<<<<<<< HEAD
o investigate failure in erlang qc-tests

o refactoring of the whole transaction-mess
    goals:
      1. transactions can be created on the stack
      2. transactions are no longer a linked list
      3. transaction operations are not handled in a separate tree but
            are attached to the btree nodes
      4. remove that awful complexity that currently exists

    implementation steps:
      x create new structure DeltaUpdate - identical to TransactionOperation,
            but part of the Btree sources
      x SortedDeltaUpdates is a vector which is sorted by key and attached to
            a node (the node manages this vector)
      x UnsortedDeltaUpdates is a vector which is appended to only, no lookup
      x Each Transaction has a UnsortedDeltaUpdates
      x Each DeltaUpdate has a state (committed or aborted, txn-id)
      x As soon as a Transaction is committed or aborted then the state of
            its DeltaUpdates is updated
      x insert: check/update DeltaUpdates instead of TxnTree
        x perform a lookup on that key
        x check for conflict or if the key was erased before
        x if not: insert a new DeltaUpdate
      x erase: check/update DeltaUpdates instead of TxnTree
      x find: check DeltaUpdates instead of TxnTree
      x simple tests should work (no cursors, no splits/merges)
      x If a node is split or merged then the DeltaUpdates are re-distributed
            between the nodes
      x cursor: consolidate DeltaUpdates instead of TxnTree
        x insert
        x find
        x erase
        x move first
        x move last
        x move next
        x move previous
      o handle duplicate keys
        o consolidate DUs/btree duplicates
        o cursor: get duplicate count
        o cursor: move_first
        o cursor: move_last
        o cursor: move_next
        o cursor: move_previous
      o implement approx. matching
      o periodically merge committed deltas, free aborted deltas
        o make sure that attached cursors are coupled to the
            new btree item
        o if keys are deleted then 'nil' the cursors
            o this needs to be documented b/c it's a semantic change
      o temp transactions are created on the stack
        -> temp transactions are not stored in a linked list
        o (non-temp) transactions form a single linked list, not a double one
      o finally clean up the remaining code (rb.h, txn_index etc)

      o cursor: when deleting a key and the deleted key/record is fetched
            -> return HAM_KEY_NOT_FOUND
      o txn_cursor.cpp: either rewrite or delete
      o github issue tracker has more bugs regarding approx. matching
      o new tests:
            BEGIN T1; INSERT K1; ERASE K1; FIND K1; -> error
            BEGIN T1; INSERT K1; ERASE K1; FIND K1 in T2; -> conflict
            BEGIN T1; INSERT K1; ERASE K1; COMMIT T1; FIND K1; -> error
            BEGIN T1; INSERT K1; ERASE K1; COMMIT T1; FIND K1 in T2; -> error

      o create cursors on the stack as well
            o cursors should form a single-linked list





=======
------------- hamsterdb-erlang 2.1.9 ---------------------------------

o improve erlang integration
    o integration for quickcheck-ci.com
    x look into Thomas' mail

------------- hamsterdb pro 2.1.9 ------------------------------------

x documentation rewrite
    x use github wiki, remove old cruft
    x then create the initial repository:
        https://github.com/blog/699-making-github-more-open-git-backed-wikis

    x /introduction
    x /evaluate & benchmark
    x /faq (merge w/ performance)
    x /tutorial
        ... (existing stuff)
    x /pro
    x /hola
    x API pages
        overview (description, status)
        installation
        usage (compiling, linking)
        api functions (link to doxygen)
        samples
        x c
        x c++
        x java
        x dotnet
        x erlang
        x python
        x protobuf

    x have the hamsterdb/documentation directory "link" to the git project

x get rid of HAM_API_REVISION, move HAM_VERSION_* to the header file, or
            move version.h to include/ham

x refactoring: the ByteArray should be non-copyable, or at least
    clearly define the copying semantics regarding ownership. Also
    review its uses, try to figure out how it can be improved. Should it be a
    DynamicArray<uint8_t>?

x Zint32: still has a few bugs when running unittests because
    index->used_size is miscalculated
    gdb --args ./test Zint*
    b zint32.cpp:66
    b hamsterdb::Zint32::Zint32KeyList::copy_to
    x then once more check the monster tests

x remove dependency to malloc.h, use stdlib.h instead

x add patches from Thomas Fähnle

x refactoring: clean up the whole Database code; it's too much and too
    complex; there must be an absolutely clear border between Btree and
    Transaction related code.
    -> should we move the transactional implementations to their own
        database class, i.e. TransactionalDatabase?
    x LocalDatabase::cursor_get_duplicate_position: delegate to Cursor class
    x when to call cursor->set_lastop(Cursor::kLookupOrInsert)?
    x LocalDatabase::cursor_insert -> calls LocalDatabase::insert
        x remove BtreeCursor::insert, it does not have relevant code
    x LocalDatabase::cursor_erase -> calls LocalDatabase::erase
        x remove BtreeCursor::erase
        x remove TransactionCursor::erase
    x LocalDatabase::cursor_find -> calls LocalDatabase::find
        x update BtreeCursor::find
    x a lot of functions have to clear the changeset when they leave;
        use ON_EXIT_SCOPE macro for this!
    x run performance tests
    x run monster tests

x #42: approx. matching: cursor returns wrong key when using transactions
    x create a unittest to reproduce this
    x the fix should be that ham_cursor_find calls ham_db_find(..., cursor)

x cherry-pick the following commits on the master branch
    1447ba4eb217532e8fb49c4a84a0dc3b982a3ffe
    6a8dd20ec9bd2ec718d1136db7667e0e58911003

x Thomas Fähnle: create new parameter for fadvise configuration
    x implement for file-based (w and w/o memory mapping) devices 
    x need to check for the function in configure.ac
    x return flag with ham_env_get_parameter (not documented)
    x create a unittest to make sure that the parameter is not persisted
    x create a new parameter for ham_bench

x A few things to refactor in the btree
    x the BtreeAction classes do not need a Transaction pointer as an argument!
    x actually NO part of the Btree should EVER access a Transaction...
    x btree_visitor.h has a structure called ScanVisitor, and BtreeVisitor is
        in btree_index.h. Can both be combined?

x Introduce new option for record numbers (HAM_RECORD_NUMBER32,
    HAM_RECORD_NUMBER64), deprecate the old one. Use 32bit whenever possible!
    x introduce a new flag; the old one uses 64bit. all tests must work
    x implement (local)
    x implement (server)
    x implement (remote)
    x verify with ham_dump/ham_info
    x add unittests
        x re-use existing tests
        x also for remote!
        x check for overflows!
    x add to ham_bench
    x fix documentation
        x samples
        x header file

x implement Cursor::get_record_size for remote access

x issue43: fix segfault
    it seems that a node is removed which is not in the rb-tree. the node
    used to be there, but got dropped when another node was removed.

x Remove requirement for "delete stability" when erasing keys
    x Introduce generic BtreeUpdateAction which handles merges and splits
    x when erasing a key: also expect splits; in case of a split the
        BtreeEraseAction has to retry the operation - either with the old
        or the new node!

x hamsterdb-erlang: add support for HAM_RECORD_NUMBER32

x Zint32: add compression based on bit-packing
    -> https://github.com/lemire/simdcomp/blob/master/include/simdintegratedbitpacking.h
    x add parameter to header file
    x support in ham_bench
    x update IndexFactory for the new KeyList
    x move block/index related functionality to a base class BlockKeyList
        (w/ template parameter for the block structure)
    x integrate Daniel's sources as a library
        x add a unittest to compress/decompress
    x implement the compression
        x don't use index->used_size, it's not required
        x don't use index->block_size; it's always static
        x use delta-encoding to have better compression
        x fill in the implementation
        x add unittests (similar to zint32)
    x add monster tests (similar to zint32/varbyte)
    x don't calculate bitwidth if index->bits is already maxxed out (32)
    x there is no vacuumize prior to a split. The vacuumize is cancelled
        immediately because it is always "internal".
    x don't split blocks in the middle if the new key is appended
    x don't split blocks in the middle if the new key is prepended
    x test with bulk-erase and deltas of size 1, no records
        -> no delete stability!
    x erase: only calculate bits of the new delta, not of the whole block
    x fix the remaining TODOs
        x improve vacuumize_impl() performance by allocating multiple
            blocks at once
        x rewrite simdmaxbitsd1() to accept a "length" parameter

x Mail from Joel: approx. matching returns wrong key
    ham_cursor_find(... HAM_FIND_GEQ_MATCH)
    keys "aa", "bb", "cc", find "b": returns "cc" instead of "bb"
    -> use existing sources as the basis
    -> insert keys as suggested

x Impove test coverage of approx. matching w/ EQC
    x need erlang function for approx. matching (ham_db_find w/ flags
        -> returns status AND key)
    x for all key types (incl. fixed length keys of size 5, 32, 48 and
        variable length keys)
    x generate keys based on key type/size
    x store inserted keys
    x verify the result of the find operation
    x specify key flags for approx. matching and verify the result
        x lt_match
        x leq_match
        x gt_match
        x geq_match
    x add inline records of max. size to increase splits
    x only btree

x Update wiki documentation/web documentation
    x ham_env_create: links to doxygen-reference is broken
    x verify other links
    x update doxygen documentation to 2.1.9

x improve HAM_PARAM_JOURNAL_SWITCH_THRESHOLD
    x implement for ham_env_open
    x implement for ham_env_get_parameters
    x add unittest for ham_env_create and ham_env_open

x issue45: crash when env is closed
    Journal::recover -> __abort_uncommitted_txns -> ham_txn_abort
        -> env->get_txn_manager()->abort
    crashes because env->m_txn_manager == 0
    x reproduce in a unittest
    x don't call ham_txn_abort but call txn->abort instead

x Mail from Joel: approx. matching returns wrong key
    x increase test coverage A LOT!
    x rewrite comparison logic
    x reproduce with his test, fix the bug
    x fix the regressions (see Joel's mail)
    x reproduce crash with a unittest
        btree: insert "A"
        txn: erase "A"
        txn: search "A" w/ GEQ
            find_txn then moves to the next node, which is null
            segfault when accessing *node

x PRO: add Group Varint-based integer encoding
    x add parameter to header file
    x support in ham_bench
    x update IndexFactory for the new KeyList
    x integrate Daniel's sources as a library
    x implement the compression
        x add unittests (similar to zint32)
    x add monster tests (similar to zint32/varbyte)
    x don't split blocks in the middle if the new key is appended
    x don't split blocks in the middle if the new key is prepended
    x tests fail if kMaxGroupVarintsPerBlock is set to 4
        x also try larger values
    x reduce index size by setting the correct bit widths

o Crash when opening env and Journal is applied
    starting w/ key 1104669304804000000, the blob 729496 (and all following
    60 blobs on page 720896) are missing (= their blob headers are empty).
    -> index already has a key, therefore the key is overwritten during
        recovery; but the assigned record is bogus (blob_header is not
        initialized)
    -> the journal has no changeset
    x is the page of that blob created or modified during recovery?
        => no!
            -> it's not modified in a changeset
            -> the page is modified during recovery, but the affected record
                is not (it's nulled out from the beginning)
    x was this key the last one that was inserted?
        -> no, there are more keys following; about 60 without blob, then
            more with blobs
    o which steps or failures could lead to this scenario?
        1) a bug in the recovery process - no, because the file is already
            broken prior to recovery
        2) might be a crash during recovery which resulted in an invalid state

x Remove the changeset from the Environment, and see how it goes
    x review: every public method in Environment, Database and
        TransactionManager creates a context
    x remove ALL functions that are not used in hamsterdb.cc from
        the public interface!!
        -> only 1 left: make txn_manager() private
    x LocalDatabase: flushes/clears Context

x improve separation between logic and state; make state immutable and
    thread-safe/exception safe. Ultimately, there should be a separation
    between...
    - mutable database state
        btree nodes, blobs...
    - immutable database state
        static parameters
    - operation state (parameters)
        insert, erase...
    - the code
    Immutable state can be accessed concurrently, w/o locking and blocking.
    Mutable state is synchronized on the lowest level, with very short locks

    x Rewrite the code
        - remove dependencies to upper layers, i.e. to the Environment
        - change function names, if necessary
        - move implementation to Impl namespace and separate file
        - separate state from the code
        1. Struct Impl::XXX -> has State
        2. Struct XXX : public Impl::XXX -> hides State (private)
        3. Struct XXXTest(XXX *) -> state() returns State
        x PageManager
        x Move lsn handling to its own object, clean up
        x Cache
        x Changeset
        x Journal
        x remove Journal::set_switch_threshold
        x Environment - not virtual, has pimpl for local and remote
                implementation 
            x Environment: has common code, takes care of exceptions etc
            x *context_data -> move to LocalEnvironment
            x move Mutex handling to env.cc (as much as possible)
            x create separate EnvironmentTest class
        x RemoteEnvironment
            x make all other functions private
        x LocalEnvironment
            x clean up
            x add Test interface
            x remove "friend" declaration
        x Database
            x RemoteDatabase
            x LocalDatabase

x rebase against v2!!

x Concurrency: move "purge cache" to background
    -> Reorg the hash table. All buckets are in serial memory. This requires
      a few allocations, but reduces cache misses because there's no
      "jumping" from page to page. Such a bucket can be replaced
      atomically with CAS (hazard pointer!) and appended w/o locking. And
      it avoids frequent calls to remove_from_list/insert_to_list to push
      the used pages to the front. As a consequence, a new purge mechanism
      is required to identify "old" pages. These pages then could even be
      sorted before they are flushed. (This was tested before w/o any effect,
      but maybe back then the databases simply were too small?)

    -> The new page "list" will support concurrent reads and writes. This
      means there can be multiple threads performing I/O without
      blocking each other.

    x on a new branch! topic/thread

    x Create a generic "PageCollection" class with atomic updates
        x use static memory as default, but replace w/ dynamic memory if
            capacity is not enough
        x need a very fast spinlock for writing
        x whenever the array grows:
            1) grow into a copy
            2) perform CAS with the old pointer
            3) old pointer can be discarded after 1 second
        x assert that there is only 1 writer at a time (i.e. use a mutex)
        x when inserting: set the pointer, then atomically increment the counter
        x when deleting: simply set to zero
        x never use a lock when reading

    x rewrite PageCollection
        x use a single linked list (intrusive, just like now)
        x use a Spinlock for reads *and* writes
        . in the future, we can still add a bloom filter to check whether
            a page exists or not

    x Use PageCollection in the Changeset
    x Make sure that extracting the pages is an atomic operation (locked!)
        -> PageCollection::for_each(Visitor &visitor);
        x Use this in the Changeset

    x Use PageCollection for the Page list
    x Use PageCollection for the Cache buckets
        x must keep track of the *tail* as well!
        x if the Cache is thread safe - should the PageCollection also be
            thread safe?? - no, not required
        x fix the TODOs
        x Cache::m_cur_elements no longer required (use totallist.size)
        x Cache must be thread-safe
    x the PageManager must be thread-safe - no, it's enough if
        PageManager::purge_cache is thread-safe (that's the case)

    x Create a background thread (use boost::thread)
        x make sure that configure.ac checks for boost::thread
    x Join thread when closing the Environment
    x thread should sleep till it's woken up, either by a new
        message or by shutdown
    x need a fast double-linked message queue
    x wake up thread when new messages arrive
    x thread skips all non-mandatory messages when shutting down

    x Run performance tests
        The cache evicts too fast, i.e. 2.1.9 page_count_fetched 0 -> 9998088
        x --seed=12345 --stop-ops=10000000 --key=uint16
        x --seed=12345 --stop-ops=50000 --key=uint16
        x --seed=1380279291 --stop-ops=1000000 --distribution=ascending
        x --seed=1380279291 --stop-ops=1000000 --distribution=ascending
        x --seed=1380279291 --stop-ops=1000000 --key=uint16

    x move page flush in background
        -> A page is in use when it's added to a Changeset. However, pages that
            are fetched read-only are never added. And if recovery is disabled
            then it's not possible to figure out when a page is no longer used.
        x wrap Changeset::flush and Changeset::clear into
            LocalEnvironment::finalize_operation(abort/commit)
        x make sure this is called after every operation (exception safe!)
            -> use BOOST_SCOPE_EXIT

        x every operation stores its state in its own Changeset
            x ham_db_find/ham_cursor_find
                x unify Database::find and Database::cursor_find,
                    remove cursor_find
                x move creation of temp. txn to Database::find, then call
                    (virtual) LocalDatabase::find_impl()
                x find_impl should not have cursor-specific logic
                x LocalDatabase::find will then take care of the changeset
                    and call finalize()
                x when creating a local txn: does it have to be stored in the
                    cursor?
                x merge remote requests

            x merge ham_db_erase/ham_cursor_erase
            x merge ham_db_insert/ham_cursor_insert
        x always add a page to the Changeset, even if in-memory or
            recovery is disabled
        x when going out of scope: clear the changeset or flush it
        (cont below...)

x merge topic/perfect-world with v2
    x then remove the threading code from v2; so far no thread is required

x PRO: rebase to v2
    x regression: ./ham_bench --use-berkeleydb=true --reopen=true --use-berkeleydb=true --reopen=true  --use-transactions=tmp --use-cursors --duplicate=last --fullcheck=find ext_052.tst
    x ... then compare PRO vs APL sources and make sure they don't diverge
        too much!
    x simdcomp-tests sometimes fail. valgrind has a huge amount of errors

x PRO: add more simdcomp related functions for blocks < 128 integers
    x update Daniel's code - the repository has new patches (create a fork)
        git submodule add git@github.com:cruppstahl/simdcomp.git
    x add 'export "C"' directives for c++
    x add Makefile.am for Automake
    x new function for calculating the delta
    x add tests
    x send push requests to Daniel

x PRO: retrieve better statistics regarding compression/overhead/payload
    x for each node retrieve these statistics and accumulate them
        as min, max, avg:
        - number of keys stored
        - actually used storage for the keys
        - static overhead per page
        - overhead per index
        - number of indices
        - unused storage
    x each node has a fill_metrics() method
    x extend ham_info
        x by default, no new stats are printed
        x otherwise call fill_metrics() and print them

x PRO: simdcomp should use binary search for decompressed blocks
    (currently uses linear search)
    -> see mail from Daniel for more information, code
    x Simdcomp: find (line 152)
    x Grouped Varint: find (line 157)
    x Simdcomp: insert (line 589)
    x Grouped Varint: insert (line 570)

x PRO: integrate Nathan's sources, or start a new KeyList
    x add parameter to header file
    x add sources to 3rdparty
    x implement the encoding
    x add unittests
    x add support for ham_bench
    x add monster tests (pro)

x make sure the library and 3rdparty are compiled with -O3 by default

x various issues for refactoring...
    x merge cache_impl with cache.h
    x PageManagerFactory is no longer required
    x PageManager::alloc calls Page::allocate (rename to "alloc"!), which
        calls DeviceDisk::read_page. Why? it's enough to assign the address
        (unless the storage is mmapped)

x PRO: check recovery.pl - extended_tests are failing on PRO because the

x Sometimes the performance peaks when truncating/growing the file. The device
    should therefore allocate more space than required. If the file size is
    small (i.e. < 100 pages) then continue as of now. Otherwise truncate
    the file for multiple pages (the number should depend on the file size),
    and use this spare buffer whenever required.

    Instead of splitting pages, they can now be resized easily. This will help
    when applying BtreeUpdate. Instead of requiring a split (and a recursive
    descent of the tree), the BtreeUpdate are applied to a "bigger" page. The
    original page will be obsolete, pointing to the new page, but still contain
    valid data (including the BtreeUpdate). As soon as the parent pointer
    and the sibling pointers are updated, the original page can be
    garbage-collected.

    The actual update flow is like this:
        1. (the original page is read-locked)
        2. a new, larger page is allocated
        3. BUs are merged into the new page
        4. the old page's state is "obsolete", with a pointer to the new page
        5. (the old page's read-lock is released)
    All other changes can be handled separately (updating pointers etc).
>>>>>>> Using shadow pages to avoid spinlock contention

    o a page needs to know if it's obsolete (and by whom); if the PageManager
        discovers an obsolete page then it needs to return the new one
        o BtreeUpdate/BtreeIndex: the "callers" then have to fix their links!
        o as soon as all links are fixed the page is moved to the freelist
            - but how do we know if all links are fixed? would need some kind
                of reference counting in the old leaf...

    o instead of splitting pages: resize them (and append to the file), update

        page to the new page, flush it.

            up cache accesses

    o 4kb for the PageManager state

    o improve logic in ham_env_open
    o remove dependeny to header page in the PageManager; it now has its
        own header page!
    o clean up EnvironmentHeader, header page in LocalEnvironment
    o clean up BtreeHeader etc

o Do not add read-only pages to the Changeset
    There's no need to add pages to the Changeset if they are not modified.
    My first thought was that the lock should be replaced with a RW-lock,
    and such operations (i.e. get_record_size(), find(), purger etc) acquire a
    read-lock. But the current implementation does not require this level of
    concurrency. Even if concurrency is implemented on a database-level
    then there's no need for RW-locks in the pages (as long as blob pages
    are NOT shared between databases!)

o clean up BtreeIndex class; it has too many responsibilities, i.e.
    managing configuration, persisting configuration, btree traversal,
    btree actions etc
    o the configuration of all btrees is moved to a separate class
    o the BtreeIndexFactory can create or open btree indices; it manages
        the page with the persistent configurations
    o the BtreeIndex has a persistent configuration, a runtime configuration
        (DatabaseConfiguration) and entry points for btree actions
    o create a common root class for BtreeActions with common functions,
        i.e. traversal

>>>>>>> More cleanups
o BtreeUpdate managed in the BtreeNode
    BtreeUpdate are attached to a node. A background thread can merge them.
    At runtime, they're consolidated, and queries (and other operations)
    can work directly on the lists.
    A DeltaUpdate can be part of a Transaction.
    The existing TransactionOperation structure is replaced. The whole
    Transaction handling will be rewritten. Instead of using separate
    TransactionTrees, the BtreeUpdate are attached to the node.

    BtreeUpdate are a sorted (!) linked list. Prior to merge, those
    BtreeUpdate that delete keys will be applied.

    The Update structure should be parameterized, just like the Btree
    (i.e. use the identical type and compare function).

    Pages are not merged or split as long as BUs are attached. Instead of a
    split the page is grown and moved.

    The DeltaUpdate structure has a pointer to its Transaction. If the
    Transaction is committed or aborted, then the DeltaUpdate state is set to
    "committed" (or "aborted"). When merging, aborted BtreeUpdate are removed.
    The Transaction pointer is only followed if the state of the Transaction is
    not clear (i.e. either committed or aborted). 
       
    For recovery, only few changes are required. All BtreeUpdates are
    written to the journal. Each has its own lsn, and each page stores the
    lsn of the last merged BU. Whenever a transaction is committed
    (and flushed), all affected pages are flushed. When that is done,
    the journal file can be switched just as it is done now.

    During recovery, BUs are appended to their pages. No flushes/commits
    are necessary. It is also not necessary to re-open the journal.

    o create an Update struct
        o template parmeters for key and compare function
        o key, record, ...
        o the state (committed, aborted)
        o pointer to the Transaction
        o single "next" pointer for the linked list

    o define an auto-merge strategy
        o in the beginning, BUs will always be merged when the node is
            accessed for reading or most other operations. This will change
            as soon as data can be consolidated on the fly.
        o what if a split is required during auto-merge?
            - first vacuumize (this happens automatically)
            - either call ham_db_insert() to traverse the tree
            - or split into a sibling page, insert the page in the leaf but add
                the parent link later on (queries must make sure that they check
                the sibling node), then fix the parent node later
            - or don't split at all, but resize the page. Use logical page Ids
                and simply switch the page address of the original page,
                then split the page asynchronously
        - if the Database is closed: write all BUs to a log and re-apply
            them when the database is opened

    o Each BtreeNodeProxy manages a (single) linked list of BtreeUpdate
        o but also keep track of the tail for fast append operations
    o This linked list is always sorted
    o Add a flag to force-flush immediately (disable queueing)
    o Merge the updates (naive implementation: insert one by one)
        o ... before flushing the page
        o ... before all other operations
    o When splitting the page: re-distribute the updates to the
        new node
    o Don't merge pages as long as delta-updates are attached
    o implementation checkpoint - all tests must run
        o unittests
        o monster tests
        o performance tests
    o Then consolidate the updates piece by piece
        o for lookups
        o for inserts
        o for erase
        o for traversal
        o for cursors
        o for scans
        o ... and with duplicates

    o Replace the TransactionOperation with the BtreeUpdate
        o requires double linked list to all BUs within this txn?
        o txn is committed: set the state of all BUs to "committed"
        o txn is aborted: set the state of all BUs to "aborted"
        o move the consolidation away from the txn layer towards the BU layer

o Refactoring: rewrite the Transaction layer
    o remove the TransactionNode structure, it's no longer required
    o remove the TransactionTree structure, it's no longer required
    o temporary txn's should no longer exist as a structure; their
        BUs are automatically set to "committed"
    o move duplicate key consolidation down to the BU layer
    o the remaining Transaction layer should only manage txn-id and
        txn name; nothing else!
    o the Transactions should no longer form a linked list
    o temporary Transactions should be created on the stack, without any costs

o Refactoring: rewrite the whole cursor layer
    o clean up the public interface
    o remove the Transaction cursor, merge BtreeCursor with LocalCursor
    o there should be 3 states:
        - nil
        - coupled to btree
        - coupled to txn
        o state() - returns the state
        o set_state() - changes the state
    o key() returns the current (coupled) key
    o record() returns the current (coupled) record
    o get rid of the DuplicateCache and the duplicate index in the cursor; if
        the DeltaUpdates are correctly sorted, then the cursor should not be
        necessary (unless the duplicate position is explicitly required via
        ham_cursor_get_duplicate_position())

. optimize spinlock contention times: set breakpoint if spinlock spins more
    than 100 times; identify the bottleneck, try to improve

. More things to refactor in the btree
    o EraseAction uses duplicate_index + 1, InsertAction uses duplicate_index
        -> use a common behaviour/indexing
    o EraseAction line 71: if the node is empty then it should be merged and
        moved to the freelist!

. when splitting and HAM_HINT_APPEND is set, the new page is appended.
    do the same for prepend!

. Refactoring: all unittest fixtures should derive from a BaseFixture,
    which creates an Environment, creates a list of databases (w/ parameters),
    and if required also a cursor, a transaction and a context
    o include additional management functions like lenv(), ldb(), ltxn(),
        page_manager(), cache(), context()...
    o what else?
    o then reorganize the tests
        - public API
        - internal modules

. The PageManager state is currently stored in a compressed encoding, but
    it is less efficient than the standard varbyte encoding because
    pages > 15 * page_size have to be split. Use a standard vbyte encoding
    instead (it will anyway be required later on).





o Concurrency: merge BtreeUpdates in the background
>>>>>>> Improving reclaim_space functionality

o Refactoring: would it make sense if each Database has its own BlobManager?
    Then ham_env_erase_db would be much faster, and if each Database has its
    own lock then the blob pages would not block each other
    o are there other modules that should be "per database" and not
        "per environment"?
        - PageManager
        - Device
        - ...?

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
o LocalEnvironment::open creates a "fakepage" to find out the page_size;
    just assume the default page size of 16kb and read the first page. Then
    discard if the real page_size is a different one
    o deal with databases < 16kb?

>>>>>>> Improving reclaim_space functionality
o migrate to libuv 1.0, it has a stable API
    http://docs.libuv.org/en/latest/migration_010_100.html
    o also for windows!

o improve the webpage documentation
    o document the various btree formats on the webpage, with images
        o variable length keys (w/ extended keys)
        o POD keys
        o default records
        o inline records
        o fixed-length records
        o duplicates (w/ overflow tables)
        o PRO: compressed keys
        o PRO: compressed records

. investigate "pointer swizzling": internal btree nodes should store "hints"
    to the actual Page, not the Page IDs, as soon as the Page was loaded for
    the first time. This could circumvent the buffer cache and increase
    performance.
    How to invalidate those hints or discover that a page was evicted from
    cache?
    - Eviction could only free the persistent part of a page, and not the
        stub.
    - Could also use reference counting for the page





o PRO: Group Varint-related improvements
    o will currently not work with pages > 16kb
    o vacuumize (internal == false): merge two blocks if they're underfilled?
        we have to reduce the number of indices
        o also for varbyte?

o PRO: allow compression of 32bit record numbers

o PRO: prefix compression for variable-length keys
    use an indirection for the prefixes and suffixes; store each
    part in a slot. the keys themselves have then fixed length (2 slot id's)
        ==> supports efficient binary search!
        ==> is efficient for random read/writes AND linear scans
        however, it's very complex to figure out how to optimally split the
        strings into prefixes and suffixes
    ==> prefixes and suffixes can be stored as extended keys if they become
        too large
    see indexcompression2009.pdf - Efficient index compression in DB2 LUW
    o look for more research papers








. hola - next steps
    o support java api
    o support .net api
    o support erlang api
    o lua-functions as callbacks - then remote marshalling will work
    o PRO: compile callbacks with clang remotely
    o add remote support where it makes sense (only for PRO?)

o architecture for a new webpage
    - the new page should
        - look better (i.e. like rethinkdb.com)
        - better targeted towards conversion (like sidekiq.com)
        - be more light-weight
        - allow better integration of the documentation
        - allow the documentation to reside in the repository, not in github
    o pick an awesome design
        i.e. similar to http://foundationdb.com, http://laravel.com,
        http://rethinkdb.com, http://www.orientechnologies.com
        - http://pixelarity.com/axiom
    o use laravel as a routing framework
    o use make/m4/markdown to generate static pages:
        https://github.com/datagrok/m4-bakery
        https://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/
    o come up with a new header page (similar to rethinkdb.com)
        o show code snippets for the various APIs (C, C++, python, etc)
        o "download" button
        o top sales items, each linking to additional information
        o small footer with links to github, mailing lists, twitter
        o big "Upgrade to Pro!" banner - see http://sidekiq.org
    o come up with the full site structure/contents
        o buy - see http://sidekiq.org/pro/ for a very simplified process
        o architecture: btree (w/ images), transactions,
            journalling, analytics...
        o full documentation
        o samples
        o faq
        o tutorial
        o keep the documentation in the source tree, not in -www?
    o documentation comments are hosted on disqus
    o the blog
        o comments are hosted on disqus, articles are also written in markup

    o Makefile can "scp -r" everything to the servers (staging or production)

    . client area with (low priority)
        o authentication
        o collection of files
        o analytics (who downloads what and when?)
    . admin area with (even lower priority)
        o authentication
        o customer database
        o implementing business processes
        o sending out release emails
        o importing new releases
        o etc


. hola: use sum-prefix-trees to precalculate partial sums/results?
    they could be stored in a btree, and used to dynamically recalculate
    requested values 
    https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/papers/Ble93.pdf

o QuickCheck: automatically test the recovery feature by invoking "crashes"

o QuickCheck: create a new property for testing duplicates; the key is
    always the same. The number of duplicate keys is tracked and
    periodically checked with the API. A cursor can be used to remove a
    specific duplicate, or to fetch a specific duplicate.


. use cache-oblivious b-tree layout
    -> http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/cacheObliviousBTree.html
    o see roadmap document for more information
    o this feature is *per database*
    o calculate number of reqd pages based on estimated keys from the user
        (but what about the blobs??)
    o make sure that this is not reverted when "reduce file size" feature
        (above) is enabled
    o the new pages are not managed by the freelist! therefore the freelist
        will not need any modifications
    o after resize: mmap the whole file area. this is actually important because
        mmap is much faster than r/w; but when the database is created, the
        original mapping already exists. therefore we might have to handle
        more than one mapping in the file
    o PageManager: when allocating a new page then use the distribution
        function to fetch a page from the reserved storage
    . try to batch allocations; when new pages are required then don't just
        allocate one but multiple pages (if the database is big enough)
        -> could create a second memory mapping for the next chunk

o PRO: hot backups (vacuumizes to a different file)
    really only for PRO?
    http://sqlite.org/c3ref/backup_finish.html
    - make sure that all transactions are closed
    - perform ham_env_flush
    - then copy the file
    - if compaction is enabled: copies keys w/ iterator
        (later: performs bulk updates)
    --> think this through; how to deal with delta updates? -> merge them
        what if only a few databases should be backed up?
        what if i want to back up in a logical format (i.e. csv)?

o "hola" - olap functions that operate directly on the btree data
    -> see wiki
    -> see java8 stream API:
        http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html
    -> see supersonic:
        https://code.google.com/p/supersonic/
    -> see fast bitmap indices
        http://code.google.com/p/lemurbitmapindex/
    o create a design
    o operations on compressed data (COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), ...)?
    o use async operations or futures/promises
    o deprecate ham_db_get_key_count() (tutorial, documentation)

- bloom filter -> PRO
- concurrency -> PRO

. clean up approx. matching
    o ONLY for cursors
    o Flags: HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH | HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH | HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH (default)
    o lookup: the cursor is coupled to the key, even if the lookup fails
        then perform a lookup:
            found_key == requested_key:
                HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH: ok
                HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH: return move_prev()
                HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH: return move_next()
            found_key < requested_key:
                HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH: ok
                HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH: return move_next()
                HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH: key not found
            found_key > requested_key:
                HAM_FIND_GT_MATCH: ok
                HAM_FIND_LT_MATCH: return move_prev()
                HAM_FIND_EQ_MATCH: key not found
    o must work with transactions
    o do not store key flags; the caller has to compare the key
    o remove ham_key_set_intflags, ham_key_get_intflags, key->_flags (?)

. win32: need a release-v2.pl which fully automates the various release steps
    o delete all generated protobuf files
    o build for msvc 2008
    o run unittests for debug and release
    o run samples
    o delete all generated protobuf files
    o build for msvc 2010
    o run unittests for debug and release
    o run samples
    o build release package

. also remove locking from C# and Java APIs

------------------- idea soup ---------------------------------------------

. PRO: should we have a separate "recsize == 0" RecordList for duplicates?
    they could only store the duplicate count (but should be able to deal
    with duplicates that are > 256!)
    -> requires grouped varints

o asynchronous prefetching of pages
    -> see posix_fadvise, libprefetch

o when recovering, give users the choice if active transactions should be
    aborted (default behavior) or re-created
    o needs a function to enumerate them

o A new transactional mode: read-only transactions can run "in the past" - only
    on committed transactions. therefore they avoid conflicts and will always
    succeed.

o need a function to get the txn of a conflict (same as in v2)
    ham_status_t ham_txn_get_conflicting_txn(ham_txn_t *txn, ham_txn_t **other);
        oder: txn-id zurückgeben? sonst gibt's ne race condition wenn ein anderer
        thread "other" committed/aborted
    o also add to c++ API
    o add documentation (header file)
    o add documentation (wiki)

. new test case for cursors
    insert (1, a)
    insert (1, b) (duplicate of 1)
    move (last) (-> 1, b)
    insert (1, c)
    move (last) (-> 1, c)? is the dupecache updated correctly?

. there are a couple of areas where a btree cursor is uncoupled, just to
    retrieve the key and to couple the txn-key. that's not efficient
        db.c:__btree_cursor_points_to
        db.c:__compare_cursors
        txn_cursor.c:cursor_sync
        txn_cursor.c:cursor_overwrite
    o move to a separate function
    o try to optimize

. add tests to verify that the cursor is not modified if an operation fails!
    (in cursor.cpp:LongTxnCursorTest are some wrapper functions to move or
    insert the cursor; that's a good starting point)
