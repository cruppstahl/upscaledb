This Branch Is About Integrating The hamsterdb2 Functionality!!!!!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The big headline is:
As a user i want to run many Transactions in parallel with high performance.
I'm using multiple threads b/c my CPU has multiple cores, and expect hamsterdb
to scale with the number of cores.

x bug report from jason: crash when inserting keys

o bug report from Artem
    finally able to reproduce the crash!
    txn/recovery is not needed
    --> warning - currently, moster test files are not with extended keys
        (not sure if extkeys make a difference)
    o test without transactions and recovery
        o create monster test
    o test without transactions but with recovery
        o create monster test
    o test with transactions
        o create monster test
        
o bug report from Mark: crash in java library because native cursor is freed
    too early

o more fine-grained locking
    x cache

        x protect with mutex
    x extkey-cache
        x make sure it's perfectly abstracted

    x changeset
        x make sure it's perfectly abstracted

    x device
        x make sure it's perfectly abstracted
        x protect with mutex
    x freelist
        x remove HAM_DAM_ENFORCE_PRE110_FORMAT
        x remove legacy code (1.x)
        x remove freelist_v2.cc
        x freelist class takes ownership of freelist_cache (from device)
        x what is the difference between alloc_area and alloc_area_ex??
        x move call to lazy_create into class
        x create c++ class
        x rename lazy_create to "initialize"
        x do not create a freelist when opening in read-only mode
                or in-memory
        x freelist functions do not need to check for in-memory!
        x completely refactor/reformat the code
        x get rid of static functions in freelist.cc
        x freelist_entry_t -> Freelist::Entry
        x freelist_payload_t -> Freelist::Payload
        x also merge/refactor freelist_statistics.cc
        x check with valgrind
        x protect with mutex
    o backend
        x replace with C++ class and inheritance
        x remove be_set_dirty, replace with be->_fun_flush()
        x btree has keydata1, keydata2 - why? better use DynamicArray?
        x BtreeBackend does not require to store in little/big-endian!
        o btree.h declares many static functions - still used?
        o include the functions in btree_insert.cc, btree_erase.cc etc
        o improve abstraction
    o statistics
        o split into env/db/freelist
        o remove unused code - also from public interface?
        o protect env and freelist with mutex
        o in db: assert that the db is locked
    o db
        o completely hide the local/remote implementation in the database
        o move more members from Database to the Implementation classes
        o improve abstraction
        o protect with mutex
    o env
        o completely hide the local/remote implementation in the Environment
        o move more members from Environment to the Implementation classes
        o improve abstraction
    o txn
        o convert to clean c++ code
        o protect with a mutex
        o when changing the transaction queue: assert that the env is locked
    o configuration/env-header-page
        o create configuration object
        o protect with mutex
    o file filters -- why? the filter list is not modified in the selected
        functions; but it needs to be documented that it has to be
        threadsafe, therefore verify that the AES filter *is* threadsafe
        o convert to C++ visitor pattern?
    o page
        o do we also need to lock pages?? or are they locked implicitly by
            adding them to the changeset? if yes then make sure that this is
            failsafe! and assert that there can be only one changeset at a
            time
        o changeset::contains is not thread safe
            only used in Cache::purge
    o blob manager
    o introduce a buffer manager?
        o i.e. holds the cache and manages the device
        o i.e. for de-coupling freelist from env
        o i.e. for de-coupling btree from db and env
	o the pages are only used in the btree (with one exception: header
            page); should the cache therefore be limited to btree functions?
            then purge and other stuff can also move to the btree level and
            everything gets simplified     

    o all other functions/modules: assert that the env-mutex is locked!

    o use read/write lock for Environment
    o introduce a new lock in the Database
    o the following functions lock the Environment for reading, but the
        Database for writing:
        o ham_insert
        o ham_find
        o ham_erase
        o ham_cursor_*
    o any others?
    o make sure that the cache does not flush pages that are currently locked
        by any Transaction

o freelist: store the last successful freelist page in the hinter of the
    database

o is the recovery working if there's a crash during ham_close?

o blob_allocate: remove writev when writing header and blob body

o also remove locking from C# and Java APIs

o why do tests with 20 threads fail with oom when using mmap? the cache limits
    should still work

o implementation of hamsterdb should move into a namespace; otherwise
    there are conflicts if users have a C++ class called Database or
    Environment etc

o clean up the "close" functions
    o ham_close - move all functionality to Database::close
    o ham_env_close - move all functionality to Environment::close
    o ~Database: call close(), then simplify all code
    o ~Environment: call close(), then simplify all code
    o Cursor::close: currently (nearly) empty; merge with ~Cursor and
        Database::close_cursor()
    o do not have st2/st; just fail if there's a serious problem

o python API - update and integrate
    o rewrite with boost::python??
    o also add to win32 package

o continue with c++-ification of db.h/db.cc

o c++-ify the backend
    o replace with C++ class and inheritance
    o BtreeBackend does not require to store in little/big-endian!
    o remove be_set_dirty, replace with be->_fun_flush()
    o btree has keydata1, keydata2 - why? better use DynamicArray?





o move flushing of transactions in background
    o new flag HAM_DISABLE_ASYNC_COMMITS
    o need new test: n threads; each thread inserts keys [i*n, i*(n+1))
    o make sure that each Database accesses its own pages; i.e. do not share
        blob pages between databases. Each database stores the address of the
        previously used blob page in order to reduce freelist access
    o when flushing and values are written to multiple databases: write them
        in parallel

o need a function to get the txn of a conflict (same as in v2)
    ham_status_t ham_txn_get_conflicting_txn(ham_txn_t *txn, ham_txn_t **other);
        oder: txn-id zurückgeben?
    o also add to c++ API
    o add documentation (header file)
    o add documentation (wiki)

o recovery: re-create pending transactions (if required)
    o needs a function to enumerate them

o c++-ify the transaction






o allow transactions in-memory

o allow transactions w/o journal

o allow transactions w/o recovery

o rename HAM_WRITE_THROUGH to HAM_ENABLE_FSYNC

o new node format:
    iiikkkkkkkkkrrrrrrrr

    iii: fixed size index (skip-list)
    kkk: keys
    rrr: records
    keys can have different compressions (bitmap, suppress null, ...)
    records are compressed; will be multiplied by BLOCKSIZE (32)
    each key consists of { char flag; short record_id; char data[1]; }
        where record_id is an offset into rrrrrrrrr
    keys are sorted lazily (i.e. inserted at the end and only sorted 
        when flushed to disk or when searched

. android port (needs new java api) in /contrib directory (it's on a separate
    branch)

. new test case for cursors
    insert (1, a)
    insert (1, b) (duplicate of 1)
    move (last) (-> 1, b)
    insert (1, c)
    move (last) (-> 1, c)? is the dupecache updated correctly?

. look for someone who can write a PHP or Perl or Ruby wrapper

. implement support for partial keys

. test with tcmalloc; if it works then also use it in the master branch, but
    make sure that memory consumption does not increase significantly

. there are a couple of areas where a btree cursor is uncoupled, just to 
    retrieve the key and to couple the txn-key. that's not efficient
        db.c:__btree_cursor_points_to
        db.c:__compare_cursors
        txn_cursor.c:cursor_sync
        txn_cursor.c:cursor_overwrite
    o move to a separate function
    o try to optimize

. hash-table.h: the foreach/remove_if/visitor pattern is clumsy. use 
    functor or class w/ operator() instead
. changeset: use a generic hash table for fast lookup (but leave list in place
    for everything else)
. cache: use a generic hash table

. add tests to verify that the cursor is not modified if an operation fails!
    (in cursor.cpp:LongTxnCursorTest are some wrapper functions to move or
    insert the cursor; that's a good starting point)

. the whole c++ protocol should be c++-ified

. move the whole configuration (key sizes, parameters, page size, etc) into a 
    separate class which is instantiated by the env

. c++-ify the btree node representation; 
    o include duplicates as well! disentangle duplicates from blob-handling

. c++-ify the blob handling and split off the duplicates

. cleanup db.h/db.cc - move functions into Database or 
    DatabaseImplementationLocal namespace - but take care b/c these functions
    are also used by Cursor or other modules which don't necessarily have
    access to the Local stuff
    o db_get_key_count
    o db_alloc_page
    o db_fetch_page
    o db_insert_txn
    o db_erase_txn
    o db_find_txn
    o db_check_insert_conflicts
    o db_check_erase_conflicts
    o __increment_dupe_index

. c++-ify everything else

. device, page and os shold no longer return errors but throw exceptions

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX release 2.0.0 STABLE !!! XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

. new flag for transactions: HAM_TXN_WILL_COMMIT
    if this flag is set, then write all records directly to the blob, not
    to the log. the log will only contain the rid.
    o document this (and also the drawback - that an abort will lose the 
        blobs and they cannot be reused
    -> this affects all temporary ham_insert-transactions 
    (not sure if this should get high priority)

o hamsterdb.com
    x add twitter feed
    o API documentation: don't link to "modules" but to startup page, update
        with newest version
    o crupp.de: do a backup of the database
    . google +1 button
    . can we use something like Aller.font?

o update documentation
    x in header file
    o in the wiki
        o don't forget to list all functions that are currently disabled
            w/ txn's -> sorting dupes, approx. matching, ...
        o transactional behavior/conflicts of duplicate keys
    o in the wiki: start with internal documentation
        o transactions
        o architecture
        o btree
        o journal/log
        o cache
        o I/O
        o unittests
        o cursor(s)
        o monstertests - how to use them?

o fully (!) automize the whole release process for unix; the result (on
    success) are the following files:
    o tar-ball
    o the README
    o the documentation as a tar
    o the Changelog
    o the release notes (a template)
    o the output (xml) of the monster tests

. port to WinCE

o how can we extend the monster-tests to have reliable tests for transactions?

. if memory consumption in the txn-tree is too high: flush records to disk
    (not sure if this should get high priority)

o when recovering, give users the choice if active transactions should be
    aborted (default behavior) or re-created

o extkeys: don't use txn_id for the 'age', use lsn instead

o the DatabaseImplementation subclass is not neccessary; all subclasses
    can directly derive from Database. 

. allow use of transactions without a log/journal

. allow use of transactions for in-memory databases

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX release 2.0.0 STABLE XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

o ham_get_count: could be atomically updated with every journal entry

o when flushing a changeset: sort by offset, use writev()

o add concurrency (on a high level)

o flush transactions in background

. have a flag to disable flushing of logfiles/journal files (or flush them 
    async.)

o continue as described in integrate-ham2.txt...
