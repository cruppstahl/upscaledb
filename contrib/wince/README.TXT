hamsterdb Windows CE build environment
(C) Christoph Rupp, chris@crupp.de; http://www.hamsterdb.com

The Windows CE build environment is a Solution file for Microsoft
Visual C++ 2005 (wince/hamsterdb.sln). It compiles a static and
a dynamic library, and a few samples.

The project files are configured to work ONLY with the Windows CE x86
reference platform. (!)

If you want to compile hamsterdb for other platforms, you have to modify the
project settings accordingly.

This project *should* work, but wasn't really tested. If you have updates or
patches then please share them!
